  <h2 class='c003'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The Commander in Chief of the
garrison of Gibraltar having indulged
the Author of the following
pages with leave of absence, he accepted
an invitation from an amiable
Friend, to accompany him on a Voyage
to the Levant.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was with the most heart-felt
satisfaction, that he found himself enabled
to profit by so favorable an
opportunity of visiting a country, not
<a id='Page_vi'></a>only interesting from the precious remains
of antiquity with which it is
still adorned, but from the critical
state into which it was thrown by the
war already began, which threatened,
sooner or later, to involve in it many
of the Powers of Europe, and to call
forth the just arm of Great Britain,
to check the haughty usurpations of
the ambitious Court of Russia.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Author's friends saw his happiness
in embarking on such a Tour;
and, that they might, in some degree,
partake of it, one of them insisted
that he should keep, and transmit him,
a regular Journal.</p>

<p class='c005'>This promise the Author readily
gave, and faithfully observed.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_vii'></a>The compliments paid to this little
work, first gave him the idea of appearing
in print. Aware, however,
that the ground he had travelled over,
had often been treated upon by much
more able pens, he for some time suppressed
his hopes of becoming a candidate
for fame in the literary world:
but, after the general encouragement he
met, he would have been guilty of
injustice to himself, and of want of
confidence in his friends, had he any
longer hesitated to appear before the
Public.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Carthagena, August 14th.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
    <div  class='drop-capanf0_3_0_5'>In compliance with your request, I</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I have kept a regular Journal of my</div>
      <div class='line'>Voyage, which I now inclose you:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Tuesday, August 7th, Noon.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capanf0_3_0_5 c013'>At eight o'clock, yesterday morning,
we left Gibraltar, with a contrary wind;
and, on the first tack, we passed Ceuta,
a place of no great intrinsic value,
<a id='Page_2'></a>but an indifferent port. It is situated
on a peninsula of Africa, which, with
Gibraltar, Spartel and Trafalgar, forms
the Straits, and is so strongly fortified by
Nature, that, although the Moors have
often besieged it, it has withstood all
their efforts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Count Julian was Governor of this
place, at the time Roderigo ravished
his daughter, the beautiful <i>Cava</i>. The
Count, inflamed with rage at the dishonor
perpetrated on his family, and
distracted at the ruin of his own child,
forgot his duty to his country, which
no private injuries can excuse, and engaged
to put the Moors in possession of
Spain, if they would revenge him on
his abandoned Monarch.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is not easy to determine who were
the first inhabitants of Spain. We know
that it was subdued by the Carthaginians
before the Christian æra, and that they
<a id='Page_3'></a>were conquered by the Romans; who,
in their turn, yielded to the Goths, from
whom Roderigo was descended.</p>

<p class='c005'>At this time, the Saracens (the name
the followers of Mahomet assumed) emigrating
from Arabia, had overrun the
neighbouring parts of Africa, which they
have kept possession of ever since. To
these people, Count Julian, with great
truth, represented Roderic as a Prince
universally detested, and whose tyranny
promised a general insurrection among
the Goths. The Saracen Chief at first
doubted the Count's sincerity, but at last
sent over a large army, which gained a
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. D. 712<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> complete victory over
Roderigo, who was killed in the action;
and the whole country submitted to the Moors.</p>

<p class='c005'>Divisions arising among the conquerors,
the natives, in less than six years, again
appeared in arms, and the Saracens gradually
<a id='Page_4'></a>declined for near two centuries.
Almanzor then arose, and, by his repeated
victories, revived the affairs of his countrymen:
But, on the death of this great
General, the Christians again made head,
and reduced the Moors to such straits,
that, although Mahomet Ben Joseph,
Sovereign of Barbary, came over to their
assistance with all his forces, he was entirely
defeated. A. D. 1212.</p>

<p class='c005'>The same dissensions, however, which
had ruined the Saracens, now broke
out among the Christians, and enabled
the former to shelter themselves
in Grenada, the only province now remaining
to them in Spain. Here they
continued till the different monarchies
which had been erected on their ruin,
were all, except Navarre, united under
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. D. 1492.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Ferdinand and Isabella.
Grenadawas then taken; but the Moors
were allowed to remain in the country,
as subjects, till the reign of Philip
<a id='Page_5'></a>the Third, who, in apprehension of an
insurrection, banished them entirely
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. D. 1602.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> from out of his kingdom.
The depopulation which this measure
occasioned, is sensibly felt to the present
day. Count Julian was himself put to
death by the Moors, on a suspicion that
he intended to desert their cause. His
fate afforded us an ample field for reflection.</p>

<p class='c005'>We continued our course along the
Barbary shore till midnight. We were
then obliged to tack, and are now opposite
Malaga, twenty leagues from Gibraltar.
This, considering that the wind has been
constantly easterly, is no bad specimen of
our sailing.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the spot we are passing, Sir George
Rooke, soon after he had taken Gibraltar,
engaged the Grand Fleet of France, consisting
of fifty-two sail of the line. The
English and Dutch had as many ships;
<a id='Page_6'></a>but the French, being later from port,
were much better manned, and in superior
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> August 13, 1704.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> condition. The
battle lasted all the day. Both sides
suffered a very severe loss in men; but
not one vessel was taken or destroyed.
Each claimed the victory; but the French
Admirals took care not to face us again
during the whole of the war.</p>
<p class='c004'>August 8th and 9th.</p>
<p class='c004'>Calms and light easterly winds. The
sea, for several miles round us, is entirely
covered with the spawn of fish. Philosophers
have not been able to determine
how these animals are engendered: I will
therefore pass them over. The Grenada
mountains rise to a stupendous height on
our left, and, even at this late season, their
heads are covered with snow.</p>
<p class='c004'>August 10th, Noon.</p>
<p class='c004'>We have been, all this morning, in
sight of Almeria. The more, for two or
<a id='Page_7'></a>three leagues on each side, is almost flat,
with a very fine beach; but the town itself
displays all the variety of hill, dale
and water. It stands on a river, whose
banks seem in high cultivation, and are
over-hung by prodigious mountains;
whilst the low ground, particularly to the
east, rises in a gradual slope, covered with
groves and avenues of olive, and cork-trees,
interspersed with vines and green
canes. This beautiful spot forms a kind
of amphitheatre, enclosed by the Grenadines,
whose rugged summits appear almost
inaccessible.</p>

<p class='c005'>On a steep ascent, at the West end of
the town, stands a large Moorish castle,
in very good repair. At present it is only
respectable for its antiquity; but, in
1147, it made a most vigorous defence
against Conrad the Third, assisted by the
French, Genoese, and Pisans; and, after a
glorious resistance, it was taken by assault,
and all the Moors most inhumanly put to
<a id='Page_8'></a>death. Vast riches were found in the
place, particularly the famous Agate ship,
which is still shewn by the Genoese, as
one of the most valuable curiosities in
Genoa. The castle of Almeria is an exact
copy of that at Gibraltar, and, like it, is
commanded by an height immediately
above it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dusk. Early in the afternoon, a
breeze sprang up, and we are now off
Cape de Gatt, about six leagues from Almeria,
and fifty-two from Gibraltar. On
the point, the Spaniards have a small
barbette battery. The land, for some
miles on each side, is almost perpendicular;
but, although we are near a league
from the shore, we have soundings in
sixteen fathoms. The easterly wind continuing,
we have just tacked, and are
standing to the South.</p>
<p class='c004'>August 11th.</p>
<p class='c004'>In the morning, we made Abido, an
island of rocks, on the Barbary shore,
<a id='Page_9'></a><span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 35° 44′, Long. 51′ W.</span>  and, in the
afternoon, passed between the island and
the main, which no British ship, I believe,
ever did before. The passage is
barely three leagues wide; but the shallowest
water, three quarters of a mile
from the rocks, was thirty-seven fathoms.
The wind being contrary, we were several
hours in working through.</p>
<p class='c004'>August 12th.</p>
<p class='c004'>During last night, we crossed from the
African to the Spanish shore, where the
wind has left us in a calm.</p>
<p class='c004'>August 13th, Mid-day.</p>
<p class='c004'>We are now in sight of Almazaron, a
scattered village, at the bottom of a small
bay, well flanked by some little works on
the cliffs on each side. At 4 P. M. tacked
in fifteen fathoms water, one mile off
Cape Tignose. On the west side of this
point, there is good anchorage, well sheltered
from the east wind. The Spaniards
<a id='Page_10'></a>have a white tower on the point, on
which they have mounted two or three
small guns; and, indeed, we have scarce
seen a spot on the coast of Spain, that a
boat could land on, but what is defended
by a tower or a little battery. Slight as
these works appear, they not only check
the smugglers, but have frequently been
of service in protecting the coasters from
the depredations of the Barbary corsairs;
while they also communicate intelligence,
by signals, from one extremity of the
kingdom to the other, in very few
hours.</p>
<p class='c004'>Tuesday, August 14th.</p>
<p class='c004'>The wind blowing hard from the
East, with a heavy swell, we have anchored
off the mouth of Carthagena
harbour.</p>

<p class='c005'>Notwithstanding the adverse winds,
nothing could be more pleasant than our
voyage. We have crossed the Mediterranean
<a id='Page_11'></a>several times, but have never been
more than twelve hours out of sight of
land; and the weather, till last night,
was so moderate, that not a soul has been
sea sick.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Spaniards have been remarkably
civil. They have made a thousand apologies
for putting us under quarantine, and
have promised to send us every thing we
may want. Carthagena is in <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 37° 42′, Long. 58′ W.</span>
two hundred and fifty miles
from Gibraltar. It was built by Asdrubal,
from whose country it took its
name. I will be more particular in my
next letter.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'>LETTER II.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'>Carthagena, August 15th.</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>The entrance of this harbour is not
more than six hundred yards wide,
and is flanked by about thirty guns on
the east side, and two-and-twenty on the
west: But, as troops coming from the
town, must take a considerable circuit
round the water, I imagine that, on a
sudden attack, these batteries would not
be manned in less than two hours. I can
discern no embrazures on the line wall
towards the sea; but, on the pier without
the gates, there is a low battery of fifty
heavy guns, to defend the entrance of
the bason at the west end of the town.
This passage has no defence on the opposite
side, but is scarce fifty yards wide.
The King's ships are laid up immediately
within it. At present, they amount to
<a id='Page_13'></a>twenty-one sail of the line, besides frigates;
but they are so closely lashed together,
that, if one took fire, the whole,
in all probability, would be consumed.
None of them are coppered, nor have
they any masts standing; and, although
Carthagena is the second naval arsenal in
Spain, nothing like a man of war in any
readiness for service; is here to be seen,
except a small copper-bottomed brig, and
a few galleys: of these the brig only is in
commission.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The dock-yard is contiguous to the
bason, and both are commanded by several
heights. Two of these are secured
by redoubts; the rest are intrusted to
crosses. The works round the city are, I
believe, but weak; and there are several
fine landing places within a day's march
of the town.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. <span class='small'>This was only four weeks before the French
Ambassador delivered the hostile declaration, which,
to the honor of our country, his Court was compelled
to retract, and proves, that nothing had been
pre-concerted with Spain, relative to the succours
to be given to the French faction in Holland.</span></p>

</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_14'></a>We felt much obliged to the Governor,
Don Joseph De Rocas, for his very great
attention. Besides repeated offers of his
best services, he sent his Aid de Camp to
compliment us on our arrival, and to express
the utmost regret, that the orders
from his Court were so strict, that he
could not have the honor of seeing us
on shore, until we had performed a tedious
quarantine; but, in the mean while,
if we were disposed to amuse ourselves in
the harbour, he would send a boat to
shew us every thing we wished, and would
do all in his power, to make our stay as
pleasant as possible. We thanked him for
his kindness and civility, and, in return,
determined to give him no trouble.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the English were once in possession
of Carthagena, and I may have frequent
<a id='Page_15'></a>occasion to mention the operations of the
British arms in the Mediterranean, to prevent
repetition, I will recite, in as few
words as possible, the rise, progress, and
conclusion of the War of the Succession.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ferdinand and Isabella were succeeded,
in 1515, by their grandson, the famous
Charles, afterwards Emperor of Germany.
Charles, in 1556, resigned his
crown to his son, Philip II. whose grandson,
Philip IV. had issue, Charles, Maria
Theresa, and Margaret. Maria Theresa
married Louis XIV. of France, who was
compelled to resign every pretension he
might afterwards have to Spain, in consequence
of this marriage; and Margaret
was given to the Emperor Leopold.</p>

<p class='c005'>Philip IV. was succeeded by his son
Charles II. who seemed likely to leave no
issue. Louis XIV. therefore apprehending
that, at the death of this King, a great
contest would arise for the crown of
<a id='Page_16'></a>Spain, entered into a secret treaty with
William III. and the Dutch, for the partition
of its dominions: by which it was
agreed, that all the Spanish territories in
Italy, the province of Guipuscoa in Spain,
and the duchies of Lorrain and Bar,
should devolve to the Dauphin; whilst
the kingdom of Spain, and Spanish America,
should be given to the Archduke
Charles, the Emperor's second son, the
eldest being already provided for. It is
to be observed, that these sons were by
the Emperor's second marriage, Margaret
and all her issue being dead. The Dauphin
would therefore have been the undoubted
heir apparent, had not his father, on his
marriage, renounced his right.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Spaniards, who were so nearly
concerned, knew nothing of this Partition
Treaty. Soon after its conclusion,
Charles II. of Spain died, and, by his will,
left all his dominions to Philip, Duke of
Anjou, the Dauphin's second son. Louis
<a id='Page_17'></a>immediately sent his grandson to ascend
the throne. This was a breach of the
Partition Treaty, which William determined
to oppose; but dying at this crisis,
war was declared by Queen Anne, who, in
conjunction with the Emperor Leopold
and the Dutch, set up the Archduke
Charles, in opposition to the Duke of
Anjou. In this war several other Powers
took part.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir George Rooke and the Duke of
Ormond were sent to Cadiz, in hopes
that the Andalusians would declare for
Charles: but they refused to acknowledge
him; and the English, thinking the town
too strong to be carried by force,
re-embarked. On their return, Sir George
and the Duke, hearing that a squadron of
French men of war, with a very valuable
convoy, had put into Vigo, determined
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> Oct. 1702.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to attack them;
which they executed with the most brilliant
success. Ten line-of-battle ships and
<a id='Page_18'></a>eleven galleons were taken, and six galleons
and five sail of the line, burnt, besides
many smaller vessels.</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1704, the Archduke embarked on
board the Confederate Fleet, and, after an
unsuccessful attempt on Barcelona, set
off for Lisbon, the Portuguese having
espoused his cause against Philip. In the
mean while, Sir George took Gibraltar,
and engaged Count Thoulouse off Malaga.
Gibraltar was immediately besieged
by the French and Spaniards, but was relieved
by Admiral Leake, in 1705, who
took a line-of-battle ship, and burnt four
more.</p>

<p class='c005'>Charles again embarked on board our
fleet, at Altea Bay, with Lord Peterborough,
and the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt.
The Prince was repulsed and killed
at the assault of Fort Montjuic, at
Barcelona; but Lord Peterborough instantly
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> Sept. 3, 1705.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> renewed the attack,
and carried the fort. The town surrendered
<a id='Page_19'></a>soon after. Lord Peterborough marched
directly into Valentia, and, in a few
months, with scarce six thousand English
troops, overrun the greatest part of Spain,
and entered Madrid in triumph. His
stay there, however, was but short; for
he was obliged to return to the assistance
of King Charles, who was now besieged
in Barcelona, by General Tessé: but, on the
Earl's approach, the French General raised
the siege with the utmost precipitation,
leaving all his baggage, camp equipage,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> April, 1706.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> artillery and
wounded men behind him. Victory,
throughout this campaign, was the constant
attendant on the British arms. The
town of Alicant was taken by assault;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> June 28.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and the citadel
surrendered next day. Carthagena having
offered to acknowledge Charles, a detachment
was sent to secure it. Majorca and
Ivica surrendered soon after.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the eminent services of the Earl
of Peterborough not gaining him a proper
<a id='Page_20'></a>influence in the Administration, he resigned
his command, and was succeeded
by Lord Galway, a brave man. But, by
the mismanagement of King Charles, his
affairs fell into great confusion; and Lord
Galway, being obliged to engage the
enemy under many disadvantages at Almanza,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> April 14, 1707.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> was entirely
defeated. The consequences of this victory
gave Philip a decided superiority in
Spain.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the mean while, the Duke of Marlborough
having carried all before him in
Flanders, and the Duke of Savoy having
driven the enemy out of his dominions, it
was resolved, that the army under his
Highness's command in Italy, assisted by
the fleet in the Mediterranean, should besiege
Toulon: but the Emperor Joseph,
who had succeeded his father Leopold,
withdrawing his forces to besiege Naples,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> August 4.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and the French making
a successful sally, in which they
<a id='Page_21'></a>burnt all the batteries, the Allies were
obliged to raise the siege.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nothing remarkable was done in Spain
in 1708. Our army was reinforced, and
the enemy's distressed by the capture of
a large convoy of provisions. Cagliari, the
capital, and the whole island of Sardinia,
submitted to King Charles; Minorca was
taken by General Stanhope, and Naples
surrendered to the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next year, Alicant was taken by the
enemy. The rock on which the citadel
stood, was defended for several months,
by Major General Richards, with the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> April, 1709.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> most romantic
valour, but was at last undermined and blown
up. The General, and most of the principal
Officers, having purposely exposed
themselves, to animate the garrison to
stand the threatened shock, were lost in
the explosion; but the survivors, under
Colonel D'Allon, defended themselves
<a id='Page_22'></a>till the British fleet arrived and carried
them off.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the remainder of the war,
Charles's affairs continued to decline;
and his success at Sarragossa and Almanara
was balanced by a defeat at Villa
Viciosa, and the capture of General
Stanhope's army at Brihuega.</p>

<p class='c005'>At this juncture, his brother died, and
Charles, succeeding to the empire of
Germany (1711), left Spain; but his
partizans, assisted by the English under
the Duke of Argyle, kept possession of
Barcelona, and the greatest part of Catalonia,
till the peace of Utrecht in 1713.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this treaty, Charles resigned his
pretentions to Spain; but, in addition to
the empire, he retained Sardinia, Naples,
Milan, and the Spanish Netherlands.
Sicily was given to the Duke of Savoy,
with the title of King; together with
<a id='Page_23'></a>Fenestrelles, and some other places taken
from the French. The Dutch got their
Barrier; the English, only Minorca and
Gibraltar, with some settlements in North
America. Prussia got Upper Gueldres.</p>

<p class='c005'>Philip, Duke of Anjou, was declared
King of Spain: but, to prevent that
kingdom and France from ever being
united under one head, Philip was obliged
to renounce every future claim to France;
whilst the Dukes of Berry and Orleans
were obliged to do the same by Spain.</p>

<p class='c005'>I wish much to enlarge on the gallant
exploits of the Earl of Peterborough, the
heroic defence of General Richards, and
the noble spirit of the Catalonians after
they were abandoned by the Emperor
and Queen Ann to the chastisement of
Philip; but the bounds prescribed to a
journal will not permit me.</p>

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Cagliari, September 1st.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>ON the 16th of last month, we weighed
anchor off the harbour of Carthagena,
and sailed out of the bay, between the
rock and the continent, to the great astonishment
of the Spaniards: but, although
one might almost make hands with them
on each side, there is no danger in a
steady breeze; for the shore is so bold,
that, whilst we had soundings in fourteen
fathoms on one side of the ship, we
found no bottom with a line of twenty
on the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>The wind favoured us for some hours;
but, before night, it got back to its old
quarter, the east, and continued there,
<a id='Page_25'></a>with little variation, till the 23d. By this
time, after having had a distant view of
the high land of Majorca, we were in
sight of Sardinia, in <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 40° 10′,</span> and,
with the assistance of the land breeze, got
down to Cape Tolero on the 24th. In
the night, we passed two rocks, called
the Bull and Cow, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 38° 35′</span>, and, on
the 25th, anchored in the bay of Cagliari,
the capital, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 39° 14′</span>, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Long. 9° 20′ East,</span>
distant from Gibraltar about two hundred
and fifty leagues.</p>

<p class='c005'>Early the next morning, we got prattick,
with an invitation to dine with the
Viceroy, Count St. André. Three carriages
were sent to carry us to the palace.
The dinner was in the French stile, and
the head dish in the second course was
half a young wild boar, roasted entire: it
was superior to any pork I ever tasted.
We had no wine but at dinner, and one
glass of <i>liqueur</i> after the desert. The principal
people of the island were invited to
<a id='Page_26'></a>meet us, and among them, the Marchionesses
of Villarias and Pasqua, and
the Baroness Tauolard, the three handsomest
of their ladies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Villarias has captured all our hearts. I
have often endeavoured to form an idea
of Eve in her state of innocence, but
never succeeded until I saw this charming
<i>Marchesa</i>. With the first rank and fashion,
she is a child of Nature, and Nature in
perfection. Her limbs are most elegantly
turned, and her beautiful shape is neither
distorted by stays, nor encumbered by a
load of false <i>croupion</i>. It is impossible to
describe how such a woman moves. She
is of the middle size, and in the prime of
youth. Her face is equal to her person,
brunette, with lovely black eyes, whose
expression gives full force to the vivacity
of her conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pasqua possesses every attraction but
that of drawing one from Villarias.
<a id='Page_27'></a>Tauolard is handsome and amiable, but
has not so much of <i>L'Allegro</i> as the other
two. Their dress is like the English; but
the unnatural passion for monstrous protuberances,
which I am sorry to hear still
reigns among our fair countrywomen,
hath not yet reached Cagliari.</p>

<p class='c005'>In their manners, the Sardinian ladies
are more like the French. They say every
thing that comes uppermost, and have no
idea of reserve. You kiss their hands as
a mere compliment; and, in dancing,
whenever you turn a lady, she expects
you to put your arm round her waist,
whilst her's rests on your shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>This frankness is vastly pleasant, and is
here of no evil tendency; for, in a confined
society, secluded from the general
world, where the characters and their
connections are thoroughly known, and
where the number of the profligate is too
small to find either countenance or protection,
<a id='Page_28'></a>confidence and sincerity on the
part of the women, naturally produce
honor and esteem in the breasts of the
men.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><span class='sc'>The</span><br /> <br />STORY of LUCILLA.<br /> <br /><span class='fss'>MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED TO</span><br /> <br />The Hon. Mrs. CHETWYND STAPYLTON</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>After coffee, the ladies carried us to
see a nunnery, of which there are no less
than fourteen in Sardinia. I have ever
thought these institutions a defect in policy,
and have reprobated the idea of the
Almighty being pleased at our depriving
ourselves of the power of doing any one
good and moral action: but, in justice to
the Superintendants in this island, it must
be observed, that no girl is permitted to
become a Novice until she is fifteen, and
must then serve a year longer before she
can be allowed to take the veil; but this
ceremony once performed, she must bid
an eternal farewell to the world.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_30'></a>We saw none of the Nuns but the
Superiors and Novices. They stood within
the inner door, which, as a particular
distinction, they opened while they conversed
with us across the threshold. My
attention was soon arrested by the
youngest of the Superiors.</p>

<p class='c005'>She appears scarcely thirty. Confinement
has only softened the colour of her
cheek, and composed the lustre of her
eye. Her features are perfectly regular,
and her countenance is animated by the
cheerful glow of benevolence and virtue.
With the gentleness of a saint, she possesses
all the accomplishments of a woman
of the world, and speaks a variety of
languages, with a voice harmoniously
sweet.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her name is Lucilla. She is aunt to
the beautiful Villarias, and, like her, in her
youth, was the pride of Sardinia. Early
in life, she engaged herself to Fernando,
<a id='Page_31'></a>a young nobleman, in every respect her
equal. Their hearts were already united,
and the day was fixed for their nuptials;
but, before this happy hour could be
celebrated, the sudden death of the best
of parents obliged Fernando to pass over
to the Continent, to perform the last
offices to his deceased, and affectionate
father. Before his departure, he repeated
those endearing vows of eternal constancy;
which both he and Lucilla had
often given and received; and each promised
to write by every opportunity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lucilla kept her word; and when the
time she expected an answer had expired,
her mind was filled with anxious fears
for her lover's safety. At length she
heard of his arrival at Turin from his
friends, most of whom had received
letters from him; but Lucilla, who expected
to have had the first, got none.
She was too generous to be suspicious,
and, instead of complaining, continued
<a id='Page_32'></a>writing to Fernando in the most affectionate
terms, making every excuse for
not hearing from him, but entreating
him, as he valued her affection, to write
to her by every channel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The amiable Lucilla had still the mortification
of seeing post after post arrive,
without a line from her lover. At length
she heard, accidentally, that he was soon
to set out for Spain, from whence he was
to embark for South America. A thousand
painful emotions now seized her
breast, and her grief for her lover's unworthiness
was not the least. Her fate
was drawing to a crisis; and, as her last
resource, she wrote him the following
letter:</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Until I heard of your preparations</div>
      <div class='line'>for crossing the Atlantic, I attributed</div>
      <div class='line'>your silence to your confidence in my</div>
      <div class='line'>esteem, and in my unalterable attachment;</div>
      <div class='line'>and when I reflected how long</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_33'></a>your indispensable concerns would engage</div>
      <div class='line'>you, I had almost persuaded</div>
      <div class='line'>myself to wish that you would not</div>
      <div class='line'>prolong your absence, even by the</div>
      <div class='line'>time in which you would be writing</div>
      <div class='line'>to me: but, what I have hitherto considered</div>
      <div class='line'>as an occasional slight, is now</div>
      <div class='line'>become an injury so cruel and inhuman,</div>
      <div class='line'>that, with all my prejudice in</div>
      <div class='line'>your favor, I have great difficulty to</div>
      <div class='line'>make myself believe that I am not</div>
      <div class='line'>entirely bereft of your affection. If</div>
      <div class='line'>you are capable of such inconstancy,</div>
      <div class='line'>I absolve you of your vows; and may</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven forgive you. Mine, I shall</div>
      <div class='line'>ever keep sacred. If you deprive me</div>
      <div class='line'>of the power of fulfilling them--the</div>
      <div class='line'>convent of St. Lucia is not far from</div>
      <div class='line'>me: there will I for ever seclude myself</div>
      <div class='line'>from the world, and confirm how</div>
      <div class='line'>sincerely I am your</div>
      <div class='c006'>LUCILLA."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>This letter having only increased her
disappointment, Lucilla took the irrevokable
<a id='Page_34'></a>vow, and exerted all her resolution
to subdue her passion. Two years
after she had taken the veil, her guardian
died; and, in his last moments, the wretch
confessed, that he had never forwarded
any of the letters intrusted to him, and
that he had kept Fernando's. He pointed
to a box, where they were deposited; but
death prevented his discovering his motive
for such enormous treachery.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fernando's letters were exactly in the
same strain with Lucilla's. He frequently
mentions, that his friends in Spain had
solicited him to accept one of the chief
appointments in South America; but that
he should think the whole world itself
no recompense for being absent from his
Lucilla. In his last, he reminds her of
her vows, with the utmost delicacy and
affection. He assures her that, without
her, all situations will be equally miserable
to him, and conjures her, in the most
passionate terms, no longer to trifle with
<a id='Page_35'></a>his happiness; for, that he should be
obliged to yield to the importunity of
his Spanish relations, unless me would
again make Sardinia a Paradise, by
alluring him of her constancy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lucilla was soon informed how cruelly
she had been deceived; but, far from
complaining, she was almost overcome
with joy at the proof of her lover's
affection. From that time, she reassumed
her former cheerfulness; and, with injuries
sufficient to distract any thing less
than an angel, I really believe she is
the happiest person in the convent. Such
are the comforts of religion, and so true
is the adage--"Virtue is happiness," that
Lucilla's thoughts now rise superior to
the world; and, without offending the
Deity by heat or impatience, she looks,
with tranquil joy, for that moment which
will be the commencement of endless
bliss, when she and Fernando will be
united in Heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_36'></a>I leave you to conceive, my dear
Madam, how much her history increased
the veneration I before felt for her. Villarias
is my author. Her words, enforced
by her expressive countenance, are engraven
on my heart; but it is impossible
to translate them. The youthful Marchioness
is no enthusiast in favor of
nunneries; but she has made me allow,
that, to dispositions and misfortunes
like Lucilla's, they afford a comfortable
asylum.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Cagliari, September 1st.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR SIR</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>THE churches here are plainer than
one expects in a Roman Catholic
country; but many of them are beautifully
neat. The altar-pieces are composed
of coloured marble, with no other
ornaments than plated candlesticks and
artificial flowers. We have seen but few
paintings, and very little sculpture. The
piece which struck us most, was for its
singularity as a religious ornament, in
one of the chapels of the cathedral. It
is a group, with two figures a little detached
on each side; neither of whom
convey any idea of decency, much less
of religion.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_38'></a>The only procession I have seen, I at
first mistook for a recruiting party. It
was led by a red standard, with drums
and fifes playing Malbrook, followed by
several detachments of menial ecclesiastics,
in party-coloured dresses, with
a small crucifix between each division.
The rear was brought up by an image of
the Virgin Mary, and a chorus. These
gentlemen were rather sparing of their
music; but what they did perform, was
remarkably fine.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the second night after our arrival,
Count André gave us a ball at the palace.
The dances were all English, except two:
the first was La Courance; the other, a
Sardinian. It consists of an unlimited
number of ladies and gentlemen, who
stand in a ring, and dance several times
round the centre, in short steps, to a
measure, something like the slow time of
a <i>Fandango</i>. Every now and then, the
whole close; and the men, with an
<a id='Page_39'></a>imitation of neighing, first kick their
legs forward, then throw them back,
fall on their knees, and spring to their
places. The ring now opens, and the
two ends turning outwards, lead round
till they join. After footing it a little
thus back to back, the former manœuvre
is repeated, to bring the ring to its original
position, and the dance is ended.
The ball concluded with <i>Country Bumpkin</i>,
to the great delight of the Sardinians,
who had never seen it properly
danced. I had the pleasure of dancing
that, as well as La Courance, and another
with the charming Villarias. Different
ices were served between the dances, and
we broke up about an hour after midnight.
We were introduced to near
twenty ladies, but none of them are
worth a particular description but the
three I have named.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Viceroy is a man of good understanding,
and of accomplished manners.
<a id='Page_40'></a>He was formerly Governor of Nice, and
always remarkable for his partiality to
the English. One afternoon when we
were almost <i>en famille</i>, he said, "<i>Allons
en Angleterre</i>," and led us into another
room, where we found a complete
tea-table. He was highly pleased
at the agreeable surprise he saw in our
countenances, and we were equally
charmed with his flattering attention. He
has had some of us to dine with him
every day, and always sends his carriages
for us. Let this, my dear friend,
be a lesson to us to treat strangers with
attention. We are always sure of receiving
it abroad, and it is shameful not
to return it at home. His son, the Chevalier
de Revel, possesses all the politeness
of the French, with the sincerity of
the English. He has been in every part
of England, and speaks our language
very fluently.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_41'></a>Sardinia is now subject to the Duke of
Savoy, who by the Quadruple Alliance,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. D. 1720.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> was obliged to accept
it in lieu of Sicily, which was given to
the Emperor. It is 140 miles long, and
70 broad, and contains 420,000 souls.
The revenue arises chiefly from a duty
upon salt, and is barely sufficient to defray
its expences; but it certainly might
be considerably augmented, as the soil
produces wine, corn, and oil in abundance.
Most of the salt that is exported,
is taken by the Danes and Swedes;
the English formerly took great quantities
for Newfoundland, but having found
the procuring it from Spain and Portugal
more convenient, they now take little or
none. A profitable tunny fishery is carried
on at the south west part of the
island, but it is monopolized by the Duke
de St. Pierre, and a few more people,
who happen to be proprietors of the adjoining
land. Wild boars abound in the
hilly parts of the island, and here are</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_42'></a>some few deer, not so large as ours, but
in colour and make exactly the same. I
tasted part of one at the Viceroy's, and
found it by no means inferior to our doe
venison.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Feudal System still subsists in a
limited degree, and titles go with their
estates, so that by purchasing the latter,
you inherit the former. The regular
troops seldom exceed two thousand men,
but the militia amount to near twenty-six
thousand, of whom eleven thousand are
cavalry. Their horses are small, but
uncommonly active. In a charge we
should beat them, but on a march they
would be superior to us. The country
people are generally armed; but notwithstanding
their having been so long
under the Spanish and Italian government,
assassinations are by no means
frequent; and yet by the laws of the
country, if a man stabs another without
premeditated malice, within four hours
<a id='Page_43'></a>after quarrelling with him, he is not
liable to be hanged. On the other hand,
the church affords no protection to the
guilty.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Sardinians are not at all bigoted,
and, next to the Spaniards, the English
are their favorites. In 1708, the Viceroy
was disposed to support the Duke
of Anjou, but on the approach of the
British fleet, the inhabitants obliged him
to acknowledge Charles.</p>

<p class='c005'>The town stands on the side of an hill,
rising from the sea, with a rampart
round it. The situation is strong by
nature; but the works are much out of
repair. The worst of this port is, that,
on account of the shoalness of the water,
men of war are obliged to lay a long
distance from the shore; and, although
the bay is of a very considerable extent,
yet the channel for large ships is so
<a id='Page_44'></a>narrow, that, in working out with a
contrary wind, it is difficult to avoid
getting aground; but, as the bottom is,
in general, soft, touching is attended with
no bad consequence but the trouble of
getting off.</p>

<p class='c005'>For several leagues round the hill on
which Cagliari stands, the country is almost
flat; but, although it appears remarkably
fine, it is reckoned prodigiously
unhealthy; and it is a known fact, that
the night air, in many parts of this
island, is a kind of poison to strangers.
The harvest is got in. The grapes are
ripe; but the vintage has scarce begun.
The vines are exactly in the order recommended
by Virgil. We rode through
several of the vineyards, and found the
peasants excessively civil. They loaded
us with their best grapes; and it was
with the utmost difficulty, that we prevailed
upon them to accept any money in
<a id='Page_45'></a>return. They dress like the Spaniards,
to whom they are still much attached;
and I found my understanding Spanish a
great recommendation, even with the
Noblesse, and the divine Lucilla.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>We left Sardinia on the 3d instant;
on the 7th, at day-light, were in
sight of Mount Vesuvius; and, in the
evening, we were close to Capria, a small
island on the right of the entrance to
the bay of Naples, famous for the abode
of Tiberius. In size and shape, it is not
unlike Gibraltar. The town is in the
center of the west side, surrounded and
interspersed with vines and evergreens,
which give the houses the appearance of
so many villas peeping through the trees.
This spot is extremely beautiful; but
every other part of the island is a bare
rock.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_47'></a>When Tiberius, from the consciousness
of his crimes, was in perpetual dread
of being assassinated, he made choice of
Capria, as a place of security. It is totally
inaccessible on every part, except at
a little bay, which he surrounded with
guards, and allowed nobody to enter but
by his own invitation. Here he carried
on the most abominable debauchery; and
the accounts we read of his brutality are
confirmed by the number of obscene
medals and paintings found in the town.</p>

<p class='c005'>That which exhibits the beautiful Malonia
can never be beheld but with the
utmost horror and companion. In those
vitiated times, this unfortunate lady lived
on terms of the purest affection with her
husband, and carefully avoided the Emperor's
court. But when, from his age
and infirmities, Tiberius was looked upon
as totally debilitated, he accidentally met
her, and was instantly struck by her
beauty. The modesty of her carriage
<a id='Page_48'></a>only increased his desire. She was immediately
seized by his guards, and conveyed
to the palace, where the horrible
monster, finding that neither power nor
promises, threats nor severity, could tempt
Malonia to swerve from her duty, had
a machine contrived to force her to his
purpose.--On this she is represented,
with a countenance full of anguish and
distress. The rest is too shocking to
describe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Passing by Capria, with Vesuvius in
front, blazing from time to time during
the night, we anchored off Naples the
next day, and this morning got prattick.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Naples, September 12th.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>WE lost no time in seeing the wonders
of this extraordinary country.
Our first object was to follow Æneas to
the Cuman Shore, and on our way thither,
it was but just to pay our oblations
at Virgil's Tomb. This celebrated monument
is close to the top of the Grotto
of Pausilippe, on the left of the east
entrance. The inside is a square of
twelve feet, with three niches for urns
on the east and west sides, two niches
and a door, through which you enter, on
the south, and the same on the north.
The roof is arched, and about nine feet
high. The outside was originally octagonal,
<a id='Page_50'></a>but the angles being worn away,
it is now circular, and at a distance looks
like the remains of a small tower. The
materials are of the common kind, and I
did not observe any marble near it, except
two modern inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Formerly the tomb was surrounded
with laurels, but as every idle visitor took
a leaf, there is not a sprig left. We
could not help exclaiming against such
sacrilege; but our guide endeavoured to
comfort us, by saying that the Marquis
Salcitro had ordered a new set to be
planted.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Grotto of Pausilippe is at the
west end of the suburbs of Naples. It
is a public road cut through the mountain,
near half a mile in length, and
wide enough for two carriages to drive
abreast. Its height is very irregular, in
some parts eighty feet, and at others
only five-and-twenty. In the day time
<a id='Page_51'></a>you may see from one end to the other,
by the help of two large apertures, cut
diagonally from the center of the grotto
to the surface of the mount; but at night
we were obliged to use torches, which,
when any number of vehicles are driving
together, have a most beautiful effect.
The bottom, like all Naples, is paved
with square pieces of lava. Its exact
date has not been ascertained. The
common people insist that it was done
by inchantment, as a proof of which
they allege that no stones were found
near the entrance. It would be to no
purpose to tell them, that those who
perforated the mount, very naturally
made use of the stone in building the
town.</p>

<p class='c005'>But after all, the difficulty in accomplishing
this passage was by no means so
great as one would at first imagine, for
the stone is so soft, that until it has been
for some time exposed to the air, you
<a id='Page_52'></a>may crumble it to dust. Neither, in my
opinion, is this celebrated excavation
equal to the batteries, magazines, and
communications, formed in the solid
rock of Gibraltar by Mr. Inch, under
the direction of General Eliott, and continued
with astonishing success by Major-General
O'Hara.</p>

<p class='c005'>After passing the Grotto we drove to
Puzzoli. The road is remarkably pleasant,
great part of it runs between groves
of poplars, planted in regular order, to
sustain the vines, in the style of our hop
gardens. The vines are loaded with
grapes, and, encircling the trees, form
a variety of beautiful festoons from
one tree to another in every direction.
The ground beneath is either covered
with grass, or laid out for corn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Turning a little out of the way to
the right, we came to Lago D'Agnano,
formerly a volcano, now a romantick,
<a id='Page_53'></a>beautiful lake. Close to it is a little
cave called Grotto del Cane, from a vapour
that rises in it so obnoxious to dogs,
that it kills them in a few minutes, and
doubtless it would have the same effect
on man, or any other animal, whose
head was held near the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>Between Lago D'Agnano and Puzzoli,
on the side of another extinguished
volcano, called the Solfaterra, we saw
the Piscatelli, or Boiling Springs, of
whose wonderful effect, in turning lava
and pumice stone into clay and into soil,
I had the same evening the satisfaction
of hearing a philosophical account from
Sir William Hamilton, with which he
has already favoured the public.</p>

<p class='c005'>We hired a boat at Puzzoli, and after
rowing about two miles across part of
the celebrated Bay of Baia, with Virgil
in my pocket, landed close to the Lucrine
Lake, at the foot of Monte Nuovo.
<a id='Page_54'></a>This mountain, which is several hundred
yards in height, and above a mile
in circumference, was thrown up by the
Lucrine Lake in a violent earthquake in
the year 1538. However strange this
may appear, such phenomena are by no
means uncommon in Italy. The lake
was of course much reduced by this
eruption, and now only covers three or
four acres. It is about ten yards from
the sea, and has a sluice to communicate
with it.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a short walk in a pleasant vineyard,
we entered the Sibyl's Cave, a road
cut through a mountain in the style of
the Grotto of Pausilippe, but on a smaller
scale. The passage from the cave to
her palace is only wide enough for one
person. After descending ten or twelve
yards, we came to her baths, four small
chambers with water still in them. We
were carried through on men's backs,
with candles in our hands, and ascending
<a id='Page_55'></a>a little on the opposite side, came
to the door of her palace; but it is so
choaked up with rubbish, that we were
obliged to return without finding an entrance;
and passing through her cave
and a wild shrubbery on the west of it,
we arrived at Lake Avernus, and on the
opposite banks saw the grove where Æneas
was to find the golden bough.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lake seems to have lost the
noxious qualities Virgil ascribed to it;
but this, I imagine, is owing to most
of the high trees with which it was
closely surrounded being cut down, and
little but brushwood left. The temple
is at a small distance on the right of the
lake; we wanted to go to it, but our
Cicerone persuaded us that it would be
better to delay seeing that and the entrance
into Hell, until we had been at
Cuma.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_56'></a>We therefore repassed the Sibyl's
Cave, and returning to the Lucrine Lake,
again embarked, and proceeded along the
shore to the foot of Nero's Palace, where
the sand under the sea water is so hot,
that we could scarcely touch it. The
effect of subterraneous fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>The baths are above. These are several
large chambers, divided into different
apartments for the men and women,
with two subterranean passages leading
to the water, which unite at the distance
of two hundred yards from the spring.
Here the heat is so excessive and insupportable,
that it is supposed no longer
necessary to continue the separate passages,
since even should persons of different
sexes advance thus far, there
is no danger of their being noticed
by each other, for to get here cost us
great pain; and all our clothes, in
a few seconds, were wet through with
perspiration.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_57'></a>This is what they call bathing, for
nobody can bear the water. One of our
guides, for a pecuniary reward, brought
a little in a bucket, and boiled some eggs
in it, which were afterwards served at
our table in a shady spot on the adjoining
classic ground; and we crowned this
grateful repast with the health of a favorite
fair, in a smiling bumper of real
Falernian, from the very vineyards which
have been celebrated by Horace. The
wine was remarkably good, and the
heavenly toast gave it a still higher
flavour. I am convinced that it would
have found its way to England, had
not the Italians lost the art of preserving
it. One must therefore either drink it
new or sour.</p>

<p class='c005'>About two miles from Nero's Baths,
we were shewn the Temple of Diana,
a large dome, one half of which was
destroyed by an earthquake, the other
remains. The Temple of Mercury is
<a id='Page_58'></a>on the opposite side of a modern bridge.
The dome is still entire, and is seventy
feet in diameter. It has a similar effect
to the whispering gallery at St.
Paul's. Part of the roof is lined with
common mosaic. The walls of the different
out-offices are still standing, and
the court has been lately planted with
lemon and orange trees, which, in time,
will add greatly to the beauty of its appearance.
This spot seems to have been
particularly sacred, for not an hundred
yards further is a large octagon
tower, the remains of a Temple of Venus
Genetrix, but no other vestige of it
is left.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here we again embarked, and after
rowing some little way along the shore,
landed and walked to the top of a hill,
from which we had a view of the Elysian
Fields, and of Lake Acheron below
us. The lake is changed, like Avernus,
but the Elysian Fields are still a beautiful
<a id='Page_59'></a>wilderness. On our way we passed
several ancient burying-places, and a
variety of other ruins--ruins in the
truest sense of the word, for the whole
is an heap of rubbish.</p>

<p class='c005'>A little beyond this is the famous
reservoir constructed for the use of the
Roman Navy. The roof is supported
by forty-eight square pillars, with a proportional
number of arches, something
in the style of the Nun's Cistern at
Gibraltar, but on a scale so much more
grand, that it would contain above an
hundred times the quantity of water.</p>

<p class='c005'>From thence we proceeded through
a vineyard to an amazing subterraneous
building, supposed to have been Nero's
prisons. The gallery is about twelve
feet high, and nine wide. We were
told that it proceeds in a right line from
the entrance to the sea, and is divided
into near an hundred apartments; but
<a id='Page_60'></a>as it is full of stones, and as the air is
said to be prodigiously hurtful, we could
not prevail on our guide to descend to
any distance in this direction, but, turning
to the left, we entered a range of
apartments in the form of a cross, which
we supposed were for the officers, as
the partition walls are only carried to
within two feet of the arch. In the
inmost fourteen bronze lamps were
found. The niches they stood in still
remain. On striking the ground, it returned
a hollow sound, as if there was
a range of prisons beneath.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as we returned to day-light,
we descended to the sea-side, to the
tomb of Agrippina. It is an arched
vault, fifteen feet long, and nine wide,
almost filled up with rubbish. The walls
are covered with elegant basso-relievo
miniature figures, in small squares, remarkably
neat and beautiful; one represents
a female deity, with extended
<a id='Page_61'></a>wings, soaring in the air; two others
are women reclining on a couch, but
so choaked up with smoke and soot from
the torches, that it is impossible to determine
who they are: the workmanship,
however, one easily perceives, exhibits
the hand of a capital master, who
has displayed so much taste, beauty and
harmony, that we are almost tempted to
forget Agrippina's crimes; and, in pitying
her fate, we redouble our horror
at the inhuman parricide who sent her
to her tomb.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is not known by whom this monument
was erected; and I think it
not improbable, that it might have been
ordered by Nero himself, since he is reported
to have said, that, had he known
how beautiful his mother was, he never
would have destroyed her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Having now seen every thing on the
coast of Baia, we returned to Puzzoli,
<a id='Page_62'></a>and, to our inexpressible concern, found
that it was too late to continue our
excursion to Cuma.</p>

<p class='c005'>Puzzoli abounds with antiquities; but
the temple of Jupiter Serapis is the only
one we had time to see. This was one
of the most noble structures yet brought
to light; and we can never sufficiently
lament, that it has not been preserved in
the state in which it was found.</p>

<p class='c005'>The court is a square of one hundred
and twenty feet, and was surrounded by
a magnificent colonnade, which, together
with the roof and pavement, were of
beautiful marble. It contained many
elegant statues, and every other religious
ornament; but the King was seized with
such an avidity for these treasures, that
he had them all removed to his different
palaces, with the exception of four
columns only, which are left, as a
sample, before the entrance of the inner
<a id='Page_63'></a>temple, each eighteen feet in circumference,
and forty in height. The temple
itself was again stopped up with rubbish,
after all its ornaments were taken
away.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the center of the court, an altar
was raised for sacrifice; but, as it was
composed of the finest materials, it was
crushed by the earthquake that buried
the temple. The base still remains, with
the ring to which the victim was tied,
and the vessels for holding its blood.</p>

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Naples, September 20th.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>WE returned to Naples, highly gratified
with our expedition to Baia,
and, after a day's rest, set out for Mount
Vesuvius. The foot of the mountain is
about six miles off. We went at night,
in order to view the crater to the greatest
advantage, and were about two hours
in walking from the base to the hermitage.
The road, although steep, is
tolerably good; and a light carriage may
ascend the greatest part of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Father Pietro, the Hermit, received
us with great hospitality; and, although
<a id='Page_65'></a>turned of eighty, he is by no means
insensible to those charms of society
which are consistent with the gravity of
his order. He seemed a person of a
liberal education, spoke with great judgment
of the ancients, and was well informed
of the state of Europe at the
time of his retirement. In the course
of conversation, he mentioned his having
been in England, which led us to
enquire in what capacity. Conceive our
surprize, when this venerable sage told
us that he had been a French hair-dresser!
But the frankness and the grace with
which he made this declaration, increased
our esteem; and his conversation proved,
that however low his origin, his abilities
and application had raised him superior
to most of us.</p>

<p class='c005'>His habitation is a comfortable cottage,
with a chapel, and a shrubbery
adjoining, at the extremity of one of
the small mountains, of which there are
<a id='Page_66'></a>several round Vesuvius; and although
half way up to the crater, this spot is
secured from the lava by a ridge which
separates it from the great cone; and
should the burning matter run in this
direction, it would be thrown on each
side. But it is not impossible that he
may some day be surrounded by it; and
he is always exposed to the stones and
ashes thrown up by the mountain.</p>

<p class='c005'>At three o'clock the next morning
we prepared for the grand ascent, but
it rained so hard that our guide assured
us it was impossible to proceed; and, to
our infinite disappointment, the weather
did not clear up till after daylight. We
then took leave of our friendly hermit,
and after scrambling over large fields of
rough lava, in less than two hours
reached the crater--an unfathomable
fiery gulph, sunk from the summit of a
monstrous cone, which rises above every
other branch of the mountain. It emits
<a id='Page_67'></a>an amazing column of smoke, so strongly
impregnated with sulphur, that it
was not without danger of being suffocated,
that we were able to look down
it, even on the side from which the wind
blew.</p>

<p class='c005'>The smoke and daylight prevented
our seeing to any depth, but at night
I imagine that we should occasionally
have discerned fire at the bottom. We
repeatedly heard a rumbling noise, not
so much like that of thunder, as of a
brazen carriage rolling over a bridge.
These were succeeded by small explosions,
which threw up large quantities
of stones, accompanied by a flame,
which the light prevented our seeing to
advantage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst the mountain is in this dangerous
state, it is impossible to measure
the circumference of the crater exactly,
<a id='Page_68'></a>but I am led to think that it has been
exaggerated, and that it does not exceed
three hundred yards. Its sides however
sometimes fall in, and then the
circumference may be much greater.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figure to yourself what a volume of
smoke may be emitted from such a source,
and what an overwhelming torrent of
liquid fire such a gulph may produce!
Our shoes were burnt in getting to its
edge, for it is surrounded either with new
lava, or a hot, drossy substance powdered
with sulphur.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes the mountain is perfectly
quiet for weeks together, but it has been
smoking ever since we arrived, with occasional
explosions, which threaten an
approaching eruption. There was a
slight one a few days before we entered
the bay, but the lava only descended
about a mile from the crater. It is still
<a id='Page_69'></a>red hot, and at night may be seen at
many leagues distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>The phenomena of lava and burning
mountains have been variously explained
by different philosophers. Some, and
these men of reputation too, have followed
the idea of the ancients, and suppose
the center of the earth to be fire,
to which they are so extravagant as to
imagine volcanos are the chimneys.
Others suppose them to be occasioned by
the fermentation of firestone, sulphur,
and iron, the explosions of nitre, of
aqueous steam violently heated, or of
air pent up and greatly rarefied. All
these doubtless assist, or contribute to the
formation of volcanos, but the only inexhaustible
source of fire that I am informed
of, is the electric fluid, whose
powers were not discovered before the
middle of this century. This is nothing
more than the light of the sun absorbed
by the earth, which of course must be
<a id='Page_70'></a>again emitted, just as we receive in
rain, the water and the damps he exhales
from us. Whenever, therefore, the
electric fluid is absorbed in larger quantities
than the general outlets can return,
it acts with uncommon violence, and
breaks forth either by an earthquake,
or an eruption. When this happens,
and the eruption is not very violent,
the burning matter rises gradually from
the bottom to the top of the crater, and
when it has filled it, it runs over like
the boiling of an immense caldron. But
sometimes it scorns all bounds, and the
crater, monstrous as it is, being insufficient
to give vent to its violence, the
side of the mountain is burst open, and
thrown with inconceivable force to an
immeasurable height in the air. The
lava then rushes forth in an impetuous
torrent of liquid fire, overwhelming
every thing in its course. That of 1767
was six miles long and two wide, and
in some places, where it past over cavities,
<a id='Page_71'></a>it was sixty or seventy feet
deep.</p>

<p class='c005'>Eruptions are generally preceded and
closed by an immense discharge of stones
and ashes, which often create more destruction
than the lava itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>For some time after the eruption, the
lava has the appearance of melted glass,
after which the upper part breaks into
large pieces of a kind of dross, which,
in the course of time crumble into
mould, and form the richest soil imaginable,
whilst the lower becomes hard
stone. But this is the process of many
years, and consequently great part of
Vesuvius is horridly barren, whilst the
rest is most beautifully cultivated.</p>

<p class='c005'>A fog deprived us of the view from
the top of the mountain; but, by what
I saw at the Hermitage, I think it would
have been impossible to describe it. The
<a id='Page_72'></a>bay of Naples is upwards of fifty miles
in circumference, and the variety of
curious and beautiful objects, which
strike the eye in every direction, render
it one of the most pleasing and interesting
sights which it is possible to behold.
The capital of the kingdom is in the
center, with a superb Carthusian monastery,
and the Castle of St. Ilmo above
it. On the west the public walk of the
Chiaja, adorned with several elegant
fountains, and a double row of trees.
Beyond it Mount Pausilippe, with the
Tomb of Virgil; the road and town of
Puzzoli; the Solfaterra, and Monte Nuovo;
the remains of the Lucrine Lake,
and the ruins of Baia, bounded by the
celebrated Cape of Misenus, and the Isle
of Ischia. On the east the gardens, palace,
and museum of Portici, built over
the ruins of Herculaneum, Mount Vesuvius
throwing forth an amazing volume
of smoke in a variety of shapes,
according to the wind, with its base
<a id='Page_73'></a>covered with vineyards, convents, and
villas, rising out of the ashes of Pompeia
and Stabia. Beyond these Castello
Mare, closed by the Promontory of
Gampenela, and the Island of Capria.
The whole country is in the highest
state of cultivation, richly clothed with
beautiful trees, most of which are evergreens.</p>

<p class='c005'>The entrance of the bay is on the
south-west side, and is near fifteen
miles wide. Off the town there are
two moles, one for the King's galleys,
the other for the larger men of war
and merchantmen, with three castles
to defend them. But notwithstanding
these works, and the Citadel of St.
Ilmo, which, from its height, is unassailable,
and that its garrison is sheltered
by excellent casemates, I think
ten sail of the line might lay this capital
in ashes, as a first rate man of war may
lie close to the shore.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_74'></a>By Sir William Hamilton's desire, we,
this morning, took a boat from the
Pearl, and after rowing along the west
side of the town, and passing the ruins
of Queen Joan's Palace, landed at a
small village, he was so good as to point
out to us, in the neighbourhood of which
we saw the remains of Pollio's Villa,
with the subterranean fish-ponds, in
which he used to feed lampreys on human
flesh. There are some busts of his
family in the garden, and several inscriptions
to remind us of his abominable
luxury.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Naples, September 24th.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>On a hill, a little without this city,
the King has a palace, called Capo
de Monté, in which there is a museum,
and a numerous collection of paintings,
the best of which is Titian's celebrated
Danaæ. Nothing can be more beautiful,
or expressive of enjoyment, than her
face, or more elegantly shaped than her
person: but, dared I suppose it possible
to improve the design of so perfect a
master, I would say, that, for Jupiter's
sake, I wish that her knees were less
drawn up.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_76'></a>Scidon's Charity is a divine figure, and,
if possible, exalts that heavenly virtue.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Dead Christ, by A. Carraccio;
Mary Magdalen, by Giucino; Peter denying
Christ, by Morillo; the Virgin
Mary, with St. Ann, Jesus, and John the
Baptist, by Raphael, are among the best
pieces.</p>

<p class='c005'>The museum contains a complete set
of medals in gold, silver and copper, of
all the Roman Emperors; a variety of
beautiful cameos, antique vases, and a
copy of the Farnese Bull.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our next grand object was to visit
the recovered towns of Herculaneum
and Pompeia, which, after being buried
near seventeen hundred years, were
again brought to light by the present
King of Spain<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, whilst he was on the
throne of Naples.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. <span class='small'>Died on the 13th of December, 1788.</span></p>

</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_77'></a>These towns were lost in the reign of
Titus, by the memorable eruption of
Vesuvius, in the year of our Lord 79,
when the mountain threw forth such a
torrent of stones and lava, that Herculaneum
and Stabia were buried near
eighty feet deep in ashes, consolidated
by liquid fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the revolution of so many ages,
the spot they stood upon was entirely
forgotten: but, towards the end of the last
century, some inscriptions were found,
which led to a discovery of their situation;
but it was not till the year 1738,
that any public excavations were made.</p>

<p class='c005'>The King met with so much success
in his first attempt, that, notwithstanding
the expence of digging through sixty or
eighty feet of hard stone, he laid open
a considerable part of Herculaneum;
but the difficulty of removing the rubbish
induced his Majesty to fill it up
<a id='Page_78'></a>again as he went on, after collecting all
the moveables of any consequence. The
theatre alone is left open. It is larger
than any in England; and the ends of
the beams, burnt to coal, are still seen
sticking in the walls; but all the ornaments
that withstood the eruption are
removed to Portici.</p>

<p class='c005'>No lava having ever gone over the
ashes which buried Pompeia, it was
much easier cleared. Three divisions are
quite open. The first is a small square,
which, our Cicerone told us, was the
soldiers quarters. There are several small
apartments round it; in one of which
we saw the skeletons of seventeen poor
wretches, who were confined by the
ancles in an iron machine. Many other
bodies were found, some of them in
circumstances which plainly shew that
they were endeavouring to escape when
the eruption overtook them. Near the
barracks, there is a theatre, and a temple
<a id='Page_79'></a>of Isis; but, as all their ornaments have
been removed, they have now little but
their antiquity to make them worth
seeing.</p>

<p class='c005'>But a little farther, two streets, with
all their houses, are entirely cleared, and
look like a small town, lately abandoned.
The streets are just wide enough for two
carriages to pass each other; and the
ruts worn by the wheels, are still to be
seen, as well as names, and several military
figures, cut in a rough manner by
the soldiers on the walls of their quarters.
A path is raised on each side of
the street, for foot passengers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Most of the houses have a terrace at
top, in the Italian style; and some of
them have baths and stoves to heat the
walls. The floors, in general, are paved
with mosaic of the common kind; and
the sides of the rooms were all ornamented
with paintings on the bare
<a id='Page_80'></a>plaster, which we call <i>in distemper</i>. Some
of them are exceedingly beautiful; but
most of the best have been taken away.
Among those that remain, the most striking
are, Narcissus pining for his own
figure; Orpheus and Eurydice; Diana and
Endymion; variety of dogs and game;
several dishes of fish, fowl and vegetables;
a capital helmet; some beautiful landscapes,
and light festoons of the most
elegant patterns: all as perfect as the day
they were painted.</p>

<p class='c005'>A little without the gates, we saw the
burying-place of the Terentian family.
It is a small pile, with a tower in the
center, with niches for the urns, and
several distorted, weeping faces on the
walls. In one of the wells in the town,
we found several skulls, which were
thrown there when the houses were
cleared out.</p>

<p class='c005'>About a quarter of a mile farther,
we came to a noble villa, which, from
<a id='Page_81'></a>its size, and the furniture found in it,
must have belonged to some person of
consequence. The lower part is inhabited
by some peasants, who cultivate
the garden within the court, and who
presented us with some of the grapes
which it produces. The cellars form
three sides of a square, under the terrace
in front of the house, each side
one hundred and sixty feet long. We
were shewn several jars, whose contents
were solid, and which, at the time of
the eruption, were full of wine.</p>

<p class='c005'>From hence we drove to Portici, to
see the museum, where every thing taken
out of Pompeia and Herculaneum is collected.
It consists of sixteen rooms, in
which the different articles are arranged
with very great taste. The floors are
paved with mosaic, taken up from the
recovered towns, and the walls of the
court are lined with inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_82'></a>Exclusive of busts and statues, medals,
and intaglios, lamps and tripods, innumerable;
there is not an article used by
the ancients, of which a specimen may
not be seen in this museum. We were
shewn some Household Gods, and every
implement used in worship, or sacrifice,
agriculture, and cookery. A kitchen
completely furnished, in a style that
would do justice to a London Alderman.
Several scales, weights, and measures,
and different instruments of music
and surgery. Some loaves of bread, with
the maker's name. Different kinds of
shell fruit. Tickets of admission for the
theatre, and, what rather lessened our
veneration for the ancients, some loaded
dice, and a box of rouge. They had
mirrors too, which were of brass highly
polished, for they had not the art of
making glass reflect by quicksilver.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the apartments is filled with
obscene devices, particularly rings, which
<a id='Page_83'></a>were worn by the chastest matrons, as
charms against sterility; for the Romans
accustomed their women to this kind of
objects, just as they did their youth to
danger, that they might learn to behold
them unmoved. This accounts for the
very great number that have been found.
Some of them are highly laughable.
But the moderns have learned more delicacy;
and this apartment is never exposed
to the ladies.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <i>Satyr and She Goat</i> was thought
so dangerous a representation, that it
was very properly removed to a separate
house; and nothing but its exquisite
workmanship prevented its being destroyed.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is much to be lamented that the
article which might be of most service
to mankind, is the most difficult to be
recovered, I mean the ancient books.
These were written on scrolls rolled up,
<a id='Page_84'></a>and by the heat of the ashes, were burnt
into the appearance of charcoal. No
pains have been spared to unfold them,
but the operation is attended with such
immense difficulty, that as yet but four
have been brought to light, and these
in so mutilated a state, that though the
letters which are left are perfect, I fear
they can never be of any real use. But this
by no means lessens the merit of Padre
Piaggi and his pupils. It is miraculous
that they have succeeded so well; and
their ingenuity and perseverance cannot
be too much applauded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several of the rooms in the Palace
of Portici, which is adjoining to the
museum, are lined with the paintings
cut out of Pompeia; but though they
are reckoned the best, they do not appear
to me to equal those that remain on
their native walls.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_85'></a>The equestrian statues of Marcus Nonius
Balbus, and his son, at the foot
of the great staircase, are both remarkably
light and elegant. One has the
greater pleasure in admiring them, from
their being a tribute to virtue, erected
after their death by the citizens of
Herculaneum, of which they were Pro-consuls.</p>

<p class='c005'>Portici is about six miles from Naples,
at the foot of Vesuvius; the theatre
of Herculaneum is a little beyond the
Palace, and Pompeia about seven miles
farther, all on the great road to Castello
Mare. No excavations having
been made at Stabia, we did not go
there.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Naples, September 27th.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>Engagements in Naples, which
we could not decline, and the shortness
of our stay, allowed us to make
but one more excursion to the country.
This was to the new palace at Casertta.
The outside has nothing to boast of
but the grandeur of its size; but for
convenience, the plan is, perhaps, the
best which has ever been laid out. It
is a square of six hundred feet each
side; and that no room may be lost,
the interior court is divided into four,
by a range of buildings in the shape of
a cross, the head of which forms a most
<a id='Page_87'></a>magnificent church, lined with the marble
from the Temple of Serapis at Puzzoli.
It hath not many paintings, but
that of the Presentation is reckoned
inestimable. I do not mean to criticise
this admirable work, but it is natural
to imagine that the painter intended the
Virgin Mary to be his principal character,
and yet, in spite of myself, my
attention was constantly drawn from her
to the surrounding figures.</p>

<p class='c005'>The great staircase forms one of the
finest <i>coup d'oeils</i> of the kind I ever beheld.
It is in the center of the whole
edifice, opposite the church gates. The
dome is painted with Apollo and the
Muses, in a circle, and the four seasons
in the corners. The steps and balustrade
are all of marble of different
colours, on a very grand scale, crowned
with two capital lions. If any fault
can be found with this elegant piece of
architecture, it is that the area below
<a id='Page_88'></a>is too small in proportion to the grandeur
of this part of the building.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is intended that this Palace shall
contain apartments for all the Officers
of State, &amp;c. who by the skill of the
architect, will be most conveniently
lodged; as yet, however, none but those
of the King are completed. These are
finished in the richest style, and with a
neatness and elegance that prevents our
being dazzled by their magnificence.
The walls are washed with light colours
(for the Italians use no paper),
with elegant mouldings of gold and
silver, and the ceilings are adorned with
a variety of most beautiful paintings.
That of the Three Graces in the Queen's
bath, is a most masterly piece; they
have just been bathing, the beauty of
their faces and symmetry of their persons,
are beyond description.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_89'></a>Several of the lower rooms are filled
with statues, not yet put up. The best
is Agrippina sitting on a chair, with
her feet out, so very natural, that I
was on the point of bowing to her.
The Theatre is nothing extraordinary.
The aqueduct we had not time to
see.</p>

<p class='c005'>St. Januarius is the tutelar saint of
the Neapolitans. His feast is now celebrating.
The people out of doors affect
to laugh at the idea of his blood
liquifying, but when the pretended miracle
was performed, all of them kissed
the phial with great fervour. The
<i>Nobile</i> have given an oratorio in honor
of him; Sir William Hamilton sent us
tickets for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>During this festival the operas are
suspended; which has prevented our
seeing more than two. The Theatre
of St. Carlos, performers, dresses, &amp;c.
<a id='Page_90'></a>are, in every respect, superior to ours;
and yet, instead of half-a-guinea, the
price of admittance is only about eighteen
pence.</p>

<p class='c005'>In England, the singers are never
obliged to exert themselves for any
time together: here I have heard <i>La
Banti</i> in a cantata that hath required a
constant exertion for near half an hour;
<i>Tomeone</i>, though less powerful, is more
pleasing: in <i>Pace caro mio Sposo</i>, she is
absolutely incomparable. The Coltalines
make too many faces; and this is often
the case with the men; but, however
hideous in private parties, it is not much
observed on the stage. Their dances are
longer than ours, and, when they form
part of the piece, are accompanied by
voices.</p>

<p class='c005'>It would be presumption to attempt to
describe the manners of the Italians on
so short an acquaintance. Suffice it to
<a id='Page_91'></a>say, that we have been treated with the
utmost attention; that the people are remarkably
partial to our nation; and that
being an English Officer is a sufficient
introduction to the first company.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the lower sort have sometimes taken
advantage of our inexperience, it is no
more than we have suffered at home;
for, who are more imposing, particularly
to foreigners, than the publicans, waiters,
and all that class of people, in England?</p>

<p class='c005'>In short, I should be apt to give a
very high character of the Neapolitans,
had I not been told that they do not
merit the favorable opinion I have
formed of them, and that the civility of
the men often ends in winning your
money, whilst that of the women proceeds
from an amorous disposition, tinctured
with avarice: but all this it would
be ungenerous to believe, since we have
not experienced an instance of either.
<a id='Page_92'></a>The frailty of women I can pity, as well
as condemn: but how a lady can sell
her virtue, is, though perhaps it may be
accounted for here, what Englishmen I
hope will never comprehend.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Princess Belmonté is particularly
entitled to our regard. Her fortune renders
her superior to any sordid views;
and yet she has always been remarkable
for the kindest attention to our countrymen.
Her Highness invited us to a
party at her casino, and shewed us a
room entirely furnished in the English
style, with the best productions of Bunbury,
Hamilton and Strange.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have been at several <i>conversazioni</i>,
which, in the principal houses, include
every other amusement. A suit of rooms
is thrown open; the largest for a promenade
in summer, and dancing in
winter; the next for music; a third for
billiards; a fourth for fruit, ices, &amp;c. and
<a id='Page_93'></a>the rest for cards and dice. But, if
only four or five people meet together,
the Italians call it a <i>conversazione</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Court has been at Castello Mare
ever since we arrived. We mean to call
there on our way out of the bay; and
Lord Hervey, from whom we have received
the greatest civilities, has promised
to accompany us. His Lordship is one
of the King's most intimate friends;
and Lady Hervey, whose gentleness and
good sense insure her the hearts of all
those who have the honour to approach
her, is particularly esteemed and respected
by the Queen, and all the Italian
nobility.</p>

<p class='c005'>I mentioned before, that the Spaniards
ceded Naples to the Emperor, by the
Treaty of Utrecht; but Philip V. of
Spain's second wife, Elizabeth Farnese,
heiress to the Duke of Parma, giving
him a pretence for invading Italy, in her
<a id='Page_94'></a>right, he made a conquest of Sicily and
Naples: but the other European Powers
obliged him to form them into a separate
kingdom, and to give it to Charles, his
eldest son by the Princess of Parma.--A. D.
1735.</p>

<p class='c005'>All Philip's children by his first marriage
dying without issue, Charles succeeded
to the crown of Spain, and resigned
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. D. 1759.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sicily and Naples
to his third son, Ferdinand IV. the
present King, the eldest being an ideot,
and the second becoming Prince of the
Asturias, and heir to Spain.</p>

<p class='c005'>The government, being founded on
conquest, is of course despotic. The
King generally keeps up near thirty
thousand men, who seem to be tolerable
troops. The officers are obliged to have
a public military education, and are
astonished that this is not the case with
us. The navy consists of three two-deckers,
<a id='Page_95'></a>about a dozen frigates, and
twenty galleys. They are at war with
the Algerines, but seldom take a prize.</p>

<p class='c005'>The revenue of the King of Naples is
near a million sterling. When supplies
are wanted, his Majesty has only to issue
an edict, mentioning the cause, and the
manner in which they are to be raised.
He generally says, that it is by the desire
of his Council, which only consists of
his principal Ministers, and the Queen,
who is allowed a considerable share in
the administration of the kingdom, from
its independence being in a manner obtained
through the female line, as I conjecture;
for the short time I have been
in this country has not permitted me to
make myself master of its laws, which,
as well as several other matters, I must
pass over till my return. As to churches
and convents, I will not detain you with
any account of them; for they are
<a id='Page_96'></a>nearly alike in most Roman Catholic
states.</p>

<p class='c005'>Naples is in <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 40° 53′,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;"> Long. 14° 12′</span>
East, and, by the shortest course, about
a thousand miles from Gibraltar.</p>

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Off Salerno, October 2d.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>Lord Hervey and Captain Barnard,
who have had the goodness to accompany
us thus far, being about to
leave us, I embrace this opportunity of
sending you a continuation of my Journal;
a form of writing, which, in conformity
to your wishes, I shall always
prefer whenever we are at sea.</p>
<p class='c004'>Friday, September 28th.</p>
<p class='c004'>At four o'clock, yesterday afternoon,
we got under way, in order to pay the
King of Naples a visit at Castello Mare.
We were becalmed all night; and his
<a id='Page_98'></a>Majesty, being apprized of our approach,
came out to meet us at day-break,
this morning. He was in a man
of war brig of fourteen guns, attended
by another of the same force. As soon
as he was within about two miles, he got
into his barge, and, there being but little
wind, rowed on board us. We received
him with a royal salute.</p>

<p class='c005'>His Majesty went all over the ship,
praised every part of her, seemed much
pleased, and, with a most engaging condescension,
thanked us for the honor we
did him, and invited the principal persons
on board to dine at his casino. On
leaving the ship, he was again saluted
with twenty-one guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately afterwards his Majesty
sent the officers a present of some very
fine fish of his own catching, and in the
afternoon rowed out again to take another
view of the ship.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_99'></a>Castello Mare is the King's dockyard.
Every thing is in high order;
but it is entirely defenceless, and does
not give an Englishman a very formidable
idea of the Neapolitan Navy.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a village adjoining, above
which the King has built a small palace,
or casino, in a most charming situation,
with a full view of the bay. Here his
Majesty generally spends great part of
the summer, and enjoys his favorite
amusements of fishing and shooting, water
parties, and ship-building.</p>

<p class='c005'>The King of Naples is thirty-six years
old, well made, and rather tall; lean
enough to enjoy all his diversions, of a
fair complexion, light hair, and an affable,
open countenance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Notwithstanding the heavy taxes requisite
to the support of his navy and
army, he is adored by his subjects, from
<a id='Page_100'></a>the confidence he reposes in them, and
because, in affairs of state, he is always
their champion. But if he has sometimes
suffered his partiality for the
Queen to get the better of his judgment,
his people are sensible that love always
predominates in the most generous
breasts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her Majesty is a year younger than
her husband. She is sister to the Emperor
of Germany, and to the Queen
of France, and is accused of being extremely
ambitious, which the King's
easy temper, by giving her the ascendency
in politics, rather increases. In
her youth she must have been amazingly
handsome; for notwithstanding her having
eight children living, there is still something
very striking about her; and her
charms, it is said, are as powerful as ever
on the King. There is no believing
half the stories one hears; and when
they tend to scandal or immorality, it
<a id='Page_101'></a>is unjust to repeat any on mere report.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the evening we got under way,
and with a light breeze sailed out of the
Bay of Naples, between Capria and
Cape Gampenela.</p>
<p class='c004'>September 29th.</p>
<p class='c004'>Becalmed on the coast of Salerno. Nothing
can be more beautifully picturesque.
From the water's edge to the tops of the
mountains, not a vacant spot is to be
seen. The whole face of the country
is covered with vines, trees, and houses,
mixed together in the prettiest confusion
imaginable.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the afternoon we landed; but the
people being suspicious of us, we could
not gain admittance to any of their houses
for a considerable time. At length a
priest, after having carefully examined
us from his miranda, opened his doors,
<a id='Page_102'></a>treated us with great hospitality, and
laughed at the ignorance of his people.</p>
<p class='c004'>September 30th.</p>
<p class='c004'>The Island of Capria is still in sight.
Passed the Bay of Salerno, and the
wind being light and contrary, brought
to off Pestum. Went on shore to examine
the ruins.</p>

<p class='c005'>This ancient city, which flourished
before the foundation of Rome, was
destroyed by the Goths on the decline
of the Roman Empire, and in their
zeal for the christian religion, these
fierce barbarians overturned every place
of Pagan worship exposed to their ravages.</p>

<p class='c005'>The arch of the east gate of the town
is still standing. But of a multitude
of beautiful temples, not a column of
any one is left, except of three, which
<a id='Page_103'></a>being composed of common stone, the
barbarians were satisfied with destroying
the roofs. Two of these are close to
each other. The one has nine columns
in front, and eighteen on each side; the
other has six by fourteen. Each of the
columns is six feet in diameter, and the
space between them is eight feet. Both
of these temples are of the Doric order.
The third is of the Corinthian. They
are all three noble edifices, and the columns,
with a great part of the entablature,
are still perfect. Signor Pitelli,
a painter whom we brought from Naples,
is busily employed in taking plans
of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The walls of the city are above two
miles in circumference, and eighteen feet
thick, and are easily traced, as well as
the mole, which the sea by an earthquake
has left dry.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_104'></a>In the middle of the town there was
a famous amphitheatre, one hundred
and twenty-eight feet in length. Enough
of the ground work is left to give a
just idea of its construction; and the
entrance, with arched passages on each
side for the wild beasts, is still tolerably
perfect.</p>
<p class='c004'>October 1st.</p>
<p class='c004'>Signor Pitelli not having finished the
plans, and the wind continuing contrary,
we carried him on shore again to-day.
Here, in a farm-house, amidst these
ruins of antiquity, we saw the modern
method of drying figs, and making
raisins. The operation is very simple.
Expose the fruit to the sun for
eight or ten days, then bake it, and
when packing up, sprinkle a little flour
between the layers.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_105'></a>Pestum was founded by one of those
Grecian colonies, who, in the early
ages, established themselves in Italy,
whence this country derived the appellation
of Magna Grecia.</p>

    <div>October 2d.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>Lord Hervey took leave of us this
morning off Salerno, and had scarce
made the shore in a boat that attended
his Lordship, before we were attacked
by an adverse gale of wind, which
obliged us to stand towards the west,
pretty close to Capria, and, I assure you,
it is with no small satisfaction, that we
find ourselves sufficiently to windward to
fetch the Bay of Naples, should the storm
increase.</p>
<p class='c004'>October 3d.</p>
<p class='c004'>The gale having moderated, we tacked
at one A. M. and at noon the wind became
<a id='Page_107'></a>fair, but has left a heavy sea
against us.</p>
<p class='c004'>October 4th.</p>
<p class='c004'>At eight A. M. were in sight of
Strombolo, the most northern of the
Lipari Islands, which are supposed to
be of volcanic origin, that is, thrown
up by eruptions occasioned by fire under
the sea, whence Virgil makes them the
residence of Vulcan.</p>

<p class='c005'>They are also supposed to have given
rise to the fable of Eolus, from one of
their Kings of this name, who, by attending
to the smoke of the neighbouring
islands, had learned to foretell how
the wind would blow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Homer carries Ulysses to Lipari, the
capital of that monarch, who, compassionating
his sufferings, made him a
present of the different winds confined
in separate bags, that he might use them
<a id='Page_108'></a>at his pleasure; but when they got in
sight of Ithaca, his companions, ignorant
of the contents, untying the adverse
ones, he was driven back in a violent
storm, and thus renewed his former
woes.</p>

<p class='c005'>The case is different with us: calms
and light variable breezes have kept us
in sight of Strombolo the whole day.
The volcano is on its south-west side,
in so fortunate a situation for the inhabitants,
that they have little to fear
from eruptions; for the crater is about
one fifth of the height of the island
below its summit, and is surrounded on
every side but that nearest the sea, by
large cliffs, which seem to overhang it
on purpose to check the eruption when
it takes any other direction; for the
stones and ashes which it casts forth,
rebounding from the rocks above, are
either again swallowed up, or thrown
down the south-west side into the ocean.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_109'></a>In the afternoon, there was an explosion
like the springing of a small
mine. The smoke occasioned by this,
being quickly dispelled, it resumed its
former state, which, at the distance of
five leagues, appeared exactly like that
which issues from a large double chimney.
At this time it bore S. S. E.</p>

<p class='c005'>At dusk, it looked like a lime-kiln,
and every three or four minutes emitted
a flame, which blazed for a few seconds
like a furnace on fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the night, it appeared in all its
glory, with every symptom of an approaching
grand eruption. The crater
seemed full of burning matter, boiling
on its surface, and every now and then
throwing up a large column of red-hot
stones, which bounded down the side of
the mountain into the sea, and, in a
manner setting fire to the air as they
flew through it, formed one of the
<a id='Page_110'></a>grandest sights it is possible to conceive.
The beautiful effect of these flying red-hot
rocks was not lost until they had
been some seconds under water.</p>

<p class='c005'>Formerly there were only seven of
these islands, now there are eleven;
and, from the active state of Strombolo,
which is considerably detached from the
rest, I should not be surprised to hear
that another island was thrown up near
it: but such an event, although often
reported, I can assure you, has not lately
happened here. The last phenomenon
of this kind that has been thoroughly
authenticated, is in the Archipelago,
which, in a few weeks, I hope to visit.</p>

<p class='c005'>All the Lipari islands have had volcanoes
in their time; but most of them
have been extinct for many centuries.
The whole are subject to the King of
Naples, and add a considerable sum to
his revenue, from the trade they carry
<a id='Page_111'></a>on in wine, alum, sulphur, and dried
fruit. The wine is famous; I tasted
some of it at Naples, but did not think
it equal to its reputation.</p>
<p class='c004'>Friday, October 5th.</p>
<p class='c004'>At day-break, Strombolo was two
leagues astern. It looks like a huge rock
rising boldly out of the sea, seems to
be about twelve miles in circumference,
and has a small town on the south-east
side. The coast of Calabria, and of
Sicily, also in sight. Latitude, at mid-day,
38° 37′.</p>

<p class='c005'>At sun-set, we entered the celebrated
straits of Scylla and Charybdis, and, in
less than an hour and a half, anchored at
Messina.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Messina, October 8th.</span></div>
<p class='c018'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>Messina, which was formerly in so
flourishing a state, and which was
accounted one of the prettiest cities in
the world, is now exactly in the condition
of Gibraltar during the siege; and the
inhabitants live in just such miserable
places as the huts of Black-town and
Windmill-hill.</p>

<p class='c005'>The front of the town extended
along the water side, for above two thousand
yards, in the form of a crescent,
adorned with pilasters and pediments,
and a grand esplanade open to the
<a id='Page_113'></a>sea, which at once formed a noble pier,
and a delightful public walk, flanked by
a fort at each end. The houses were
built with great taste, all four stories
high, and nearly alike.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of this beautiful and magnificent
range, only the outside shell remains;
the rest, with all the town, except one
or two of the strongest churches, was
entirely destroyed by the dreadful earthquake
in 1783.</p>

<p class='c005'>The center of that tremendous convulsion
was at Oppido, in Calabria.
Every thing within twenty miles was
entirely overwhelmed, and several towns,
with all their inhabitants, completely
swallowed up, not the smallest vestige
of them being left. Scarce a place within
seventy-two miles of Oppido but felt the
shock. By the return made to the Secretary
of State, the number of people
lost, amounted to thirty-two thousand,
<a id='Page_114'></a>three hundred and sixty-seven souls;
and we were told by Sir William Hamilton,
that there were several thousand
strangers, travellers, &amp;c. who were not
included in that return.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is by no means uncommon to hear
of the Italians scourging their saints
when they are overtaken by any misfortune;
but, since this dreadful calamity,
St. Agatha, the Protectress of
Sicily, is more venerated than ever;
for, notwithstanding the loss of their
property, she has the credit of having
defended her votaries from the catastrophe
with which their neighbours on
the opposite coast were overwhelmed;
and every Sunday night the opera ends
with a little piece in her honor.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is something so amiable in this
universal gratitude and thanksgiving in
the midst of absolute ruin, that it is impossible
not to admire the minds that
<a id='Page_115'></a>are capable of such virtue, even though
actuated by superstition. But, indeed,
if we compare Messina with several other
places, we may reckon her peculiarly
fortunate, since, though the town is destroyed,
only nine hundred people perished.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the time of the earthquake, the
Messinians had scarce recovered from the
ravages of the plague of 1743. This
second blow has completely broken their
spirit, and obliged them to relinquish
the hope of ever seeing their city rebuilt;
the King of Naples having ordered that
none of the houses in the Crescent shall
be roofed, until they are raised to their
former height. The inhabitants have
remonstrated, by saying, that they cannot
bear the expence; but his Majesty is
unwilling that they should lose so beautiful
an ornament.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_116'></a>Even Scylla and Charybdis have been
almost subdued by the repeated convulsions
of this part of the earth, and by
the violence of the current, which is
continually increasing the breadth of the
Straits. If proper allowance be made
for these circumstances, we shall acquit
the ancients of any exaggeration, notwithstanding
the very dreadful colours
in which they have painted this passage.
It is formed by a low peninsula, called
Cape Pelorus, stretching to the eastward
on the Sicilian side, immediately within
which lies the famous whirlpool of
Charybdis, and by the Rocks of Scylla,
which a few miles below on the Calabrian
shore, project towards the west.
The current runs with surprising force
from one to the other alternately in the
direction of the tide, and the tides themselves
are very irregular. Thus, vessels
by shunning the one were in the utmost
danger of being swallowed up by the
other.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_117'></a>At present, in moderate weather,
when the tide is either at ebb or
flood, boats pass all over the whirlpool,
but, in general, it is like the
meeting of two contending currents,
with a number of eddies all around.
And, even now, there is scarcely a
winter in which there are not some
wrecks.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the time we passed the strait, the
weather was as favourable as we could
wish, and yet, in spite of a strong
breeze and the current, which hurried
us on with surprising velocity, the ship's
head was suddenly whirled round near
three points; but the wind blowing fresh,
in a few seconds she dashed through
the eddy that had caught her--for,
to avoid Scylla, and secure Messina,
we had kept pretty close to Charybdis.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_118'></a>The entrance of these straits is, I am
convinced, not less than three miles
wide, but I have never heard it allowed
to be so much. After passing Charybdis,
the sea immediately widens, but Cape
Pelorus and Scylla in a manner crossing
each other, the passage cannot be perceived
until you are on the point of entering
it, which gave rise to a tradition,
that Hannibal, fancying himself betrayed
and land-locked, put his Pilot Pelorus
to death; but that, as an atonement, he
afterwards erected a statue to his memory,
from which the Cape took its
name. This action, however, is so
contradictory to the history, experience,
and disposition of Hannibal, that nobody
could ever have raised such a story,
but one who had never read the life of
this magnanimous hero.</p>

<p class='c005'>Few countries have experienced more
revolutions than Sicily; the richness of
<a id='Page_119'></a>the soil and the temperature of the climate,
added to its commanding situation, having
always made it an object of attraction.
After the dark ages it was successively
possessed by the Greeks, and
the Carthaginians, the Romans, the
Goths, and the Saracens.</p>

<p class='c005'>In later times, it has generally shared
the fate of Naples; but by the Treaty
of Utrecht, it was given to the Duke
of Savoy, who, however, was soon
obliged, by the Quadruple Alliance, to
return it to the Emperor, in exchange for
Sardinia. The Spaniards seized this opportunity
of renewing their claims, and
sent a large armament, which had subdued
the whole island, except Messina,
which they were besieging, when Sir
George Byng appeared with the British
fleet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>April 11th, 1718.</div>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_120'></a>The Spanish squadron, apprized of
his approach, passed through the straits,
and stood to the southward; Sir George
pursued and brought it to action. Our
fleet consisted of twenty-one sail of the
line, carrying 1400 guns, the enemy's
of eighteen, carrying 992 guns. Both
sides fought bravely, but our superior
numbers soon prevailed. Don Antonio
de Casteneta, the Spanish Admiral,
was taken prisoner, and
only seven of his two-deckers escaped,
of which the greater part were afterwards
burnt at Messina, and one was lost
in the Gulf of Tarento. Many of the
frigates were also taken.</p>

<p class='c005'>Six line of battle ships, and as many
smaller men of war, which separated
from the main body of the Spanish fleet,
at the commencement of the action, were
pursued by Commodore Walton, and
every one taken or burnt; on which
<a id='Page_121'></a>occasion he wrote this famous letter.
"We have taken or destroyed all the
enemy's ships and vessels on the coast,
as per margin."</p>

<p class='c005'>After this victory, Sir George Byng
convoyed an army from the continent,
and besieged the citadel of Messina,
which the enemy's troops had now
taken; and when the place was nearly
reduced, a dispute arising among the allies
on shore, about the Spanish men of war in
the mole, Sir George, knowing that it is
more our interest to reduce the navy of
the rest of Europe, than to increase
our own, caused batteries to be erected
for shells and red-hot shot, and ended
the contention, by destroying the cause.</p>

<p class='c005'>The loss of their fleet, and many
other disasters, obliged the Spaniards to
accede to the Quadruple Alliance in
1720, and to relinquish their claim to
<a id='Page_122'></a>Sicily and Sardinia. But the Emperor
having forfeited the protection of England,
the Spaniards, about fifteen years
after this treaty, made themselves masters
of Sicily and Naples, as I have already
related.</p>

<p class='c005'>Messina was surrounded on the land
side by a strong rampart, which, since
the earthquake, has been entirely neglected.
The Citadel is a regular square
fort, with ravelins, counterguards, and a
good covered way. It stands on that
part of the neck of land which forms
the mole, where this neck joins the
island, and is kept in excellent condition;
yet notwithstanding its artificial
strength, it is of little use but as a
place of arms, since an enemy having
possession of the town, may destroy every
vessel under its guns; but two other
strong castles secure the shipping from
any insult from the sea.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_123'></a>The neighbourhood is excessively
fertile and populous, and we find the
people very civil; but in the interior
country, I am told they are rather savage.</p>

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Modon, October 19.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>We are, at last, arrived on the confines
of Greece, a venerable name,
now almost lost in that of Turkey in
Europe, and its former splendour so entirely
reversed, that I am particularly
fortunate in finding a conveyance for a
letter. Here are no posts in this neglected
country, and the people once so
accomplished, are in utter ignorance of
what passes in the world, except from
the vague reports they get from vessels,
which now and then put in here. And
this, alas! is the unhappy fate of all
the south and eastern coast of Greece.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_125'></a>But before I say any thing more of
this place, I must carry you back to
Messina, and give you some account of
our voyage.</p>
<p class='c004'>Thursday, October 9th.</p>
<p class='c004'>We left Messina at eleven o'clock this
morning, and at twelve passed Reggio
on the coast of Calabria. The country
appears extremely barren, but is full of
inhabitants and small towns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just before midnight, when all below
were locked in sleep, and even those
upon deck had scarce strength to resist
the drowsy langour brought on by four
hours duty; in this silent moment,
when superstition, ever powerful in the
mind of the sailor, gains new force from
the surrounding gloom, the watch were
rouzed with terror and astonishment, by
a sudden illumination of the whole atmosphere.
Their eyes, instantly turned
to Heaven, were scarce reverted, when
<a id='Page_126'></a>every part of the ship appeared in a
blaze, and continued so for many seconds.</p>

<p class='c005'>Struck by so awful a sight, in the
dead of the night, a general silence prevailed,
and many, unable to divine the
cause of so sudden, and so tremendous
an apparition, thought the last day was
approaching. Their fears were still increased
by observing through the sails,
an immense ball of fire floating in the
air a-head of the ship; but they were, at
length, relieved by its falling into the
sea.</p>

<p class='c005'>The account our friends gave us the
next morning, led us into a dissertation
on fireballs, which philosophers say are
produced by an exceeding great power
of electricity, gradually accumulated, until
the resistance of the atmosphere being
no longer able to sustain it, it drops
down slowly, and in no particular direction,
<a id='Page_127'></a>not being drawn by any substance
which would attract this electric
matter, in the shape of common lightning.</p>
<p class='c004'>October 10th.</p>
<p class='c004'>Sunset. A westerly breeze has carried
us past Cape Spartevento, and we
are now just an hundred miles from the
coast of Sicily. Mount Ætna is still in
sight, and the sun setting directly behind
it, forms one of those heavenly scenes,
which at once affects us with the beautiful
and sublime. Notwithstanding our
very great distance, the mountain is so
many degrees above the horizon, that
would day-light continue, we should see
it twenty miles farther. How great
does nature appear in these wonderful
works!</p>
<p class='c004'>October 11th.</p>
<p class='c004'><span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 37° 36′.</span> In the last twenty-four
hours we have run an hundred and
<a id='Page_128'></a>forty-three miles, and are so far across
the Adriatic, or Gulph of Venice, as
to have land in sight a-head. This
breeze is almost the only fair one we have
had since we left Gibraltar, and it is
now growing calm.</p>
<p class='c004'>October 12th.</p>
<p class='c004'>Sunset. We are now between Zante
and Cephalonia, with the Morea in front.
The part of the islands near us are
very rocky and barren, with no verdure
except from some scattered olive trees,
and brushwood; but the more distant
part of Cephalonia appears well cultivated.</p>
<p class='c004'>Sunday, October 14th.</p>
<p class='c004'>We lay to all the night before last, and
yesterday morning anchored in the harbour
of Zante. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 37°. 50′. Long. 21°. 15′. east.</span></p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_129'></a>The nearest part of this island is nine
miles from Cephalonia, and the same
distance from the Morea, and an hundred
leagues from Messina. It is above
seventy miles in circumference; contains
forty thousand souls, and carries on a
very considerable trade in dried fruits,
particularly currants, so called from a
corruption of Corinth, from whence the
vines were originally imported.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the hill above the town there is
a fort, very advantageously situated, but
much out of repair. It is subject to the
Venetians, who have now a ship of the
line and three frigates in the harbour.
The senior Captain very civilly informed
us, that, from his great respect for the
English, he would be happy to salute
us, if we would return gun for gun; to
which we readily consented.</p>

<p class='c005'>By orders from Venice, the Governor
at this juncture, imposes a quarantine
<a id='Page_130'></a>of seven days on all vessels, even from
his own nearest ports; and therefore,
not being allowed to land here, we are
going to a less frequented part of the
island, where the quarantine is not enforced.</p>
<p class='c004'>October 15th.</p>
<p class='c004'>We got under way yesterday evening,
and the wind not permitting us to continue
our voyage, we stood to the north-east
towards Patras, at the mouth of the
Gulf of Lepanto; but the wind changing,
we put about at twelve this morning,
just as we got in sight of its entrance,
near the spot on which Don
John of Austria obtained the celebrated
victory over the Turkish fleet in the year
1571.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this cruize we have had a view
of Ithaca, in which we were told at
Zante, the foundation of Ulysses' Palace
is still to be traced. His island is now
<a id='Page_131'></a>called Little Cephalonia, is about twenty
miles long, appears very barren, but is
said to be well peopled, though with a
very vile race. Zante and the greater
Cephalonia also belonged to Ulysses, and
are both described by the ancients, as
being remarkably fertile. The latter is
by much the largest, the former the most
productive.</p>

<p class='c005'>A little to the north of Ithaca, in the
Island of St. Mauro, is the famous Promontory
of Leucate, the Lover's Leap,
celebrated by the Spectator, in his beautiful
panegyric on the tender Sappho.
Even Venus herself is said to have been
led there by Apollo, to be cured of her
passion for Adonis.</p>
<p class='c004'>October 16th.</p>
<p class='c004'>Wind again contrary. Tacking off
Zante, to get into a small bay, where
there is a curious spring, from which a
great quantity of tar oozes; but not
<a id='Page_132'></a>being able to gain the anchorage before
sunset, and the wind becoming fair for
our course, we stood to the south, and
in the night passed the Strophades, a
set of small low islands, where Æneas
was attacked by the Harpies.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not without regret that I passed
by Zante, without landing there. It
was the only place in the Venetian
territories we had any chance of visiting,
and I wished much to see the effect of
a Government, in which Despotism, in
the form of a Republic, makes her votaries
believe that Tyranny is Liberty.
But by what I could learn from the
traders, and a few other people, to
whom I had an opportunity of speaking,
the police is really shocking.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Governors are generally needy
men, but, by accepting fines as a remission
for murder, they are soon enriched,
perhaps by the ruin of the widow
<a id='Page_133'></a>and the orphan.--Is your husband
assassinated--your father murdered? Dry
up your tears--your Governor is three
guineas richer. Do you remonstrate?
For three guineas more you may let loose
all the demons of revenge.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus one murder produces another;
whole families are involved in destruction,
or at best live in perpetual alarms;
justice never interferes, and society is of
course destroyed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst reflections of this kind distress
the Philanthrope who visits Zante, the
naturalist finds the tar spring an object
well worthy his curiosity. The trade
of the island is also a subject on which
I should like to be better informed. On
an average, the annual produce in currants
is ten million pounds weight. Almost
the whole of which, besides nearly
the same quantity brought from
Cephalonia, and the adjacent parts of
<a id='Page_134'></a>the Morea, are taken by the English,
who load thirty vessels every year.</p>

<p class='c005'>This trade, however, seems to be a
very losing one to us, since our productions
have no sale at Zante, and the
tin, lead, alum, and a few other articles
which we carry to Venice, bear no
proportion in value to the fruit we bring
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is true, our revenue is considerably
increased by a duty of twenty-three
pounds sterling on every ton of currants,
which is one half as much again as the
prime cost, the common price at Zante
being fifteen guineas. But this tax is
railed upon ourselves, and does not
check the importation of this foreign
commodity, since we consume three-fourths
of what the island yields. It
might, therefore, as well be levied on
some of our own productions, as on our
hereditary plumb-pudding.</p>
<p class='c004'><a id='Page_135'></a>October 17th.</p>
<p class='c004'>Having passed two little forts, called
the Navarins, at noon we anchored off
Modon, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 37°,</span>  <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Long. 15° 45′,</span> distant
from Gibraltar near fourteen hundred
miles. And now, having brought the
ship to an anchor, I shall proceed with
the observations I introduced at the commencement
of this letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Modon is a small Turkish town, on
the south-west corner of the Morea,
which you recollect is the Peloponnesus
of the Ancients, and almost an island,
being separated from the rest of Greece
by the gulph of Lepanto, and only joined
to it by the narrow isthmus of Corinth.
After the Greek and Roman ages, it was
conquered by the Turks, and afterwards
by the Venetians, to whom the former
ceded it by the Treaty of Carlowitz,
but retook it in 1715, and have maintained
it ever since, notwithstanding that,
during their last war, Modon was taken
<a id='Page_136'></a>by the Russians, who were immediately
joined by the Greeks; but the Turks
sending a large army thither, Count
Orlow and his troops were obliged to
abandon their associates to the fury of
their enemies, who massacred fifteen
thousand of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is the Turkish method of terminating
a rebellion, which they say is
only to be done by destroying the seeds:
but, to palliate their inhumanity, they
allege, that, whenever the Greeks have
gained any advantage, they have been
still more barbarous; that they have
spared neither age nor sex; but that,
after being guilty of every other brutality
to the women, so sacred among
Mahometans, not satisfied with slaying
them, they have even carried their revenge
so far as to expose their naked
corpses to be devoured by dogs and birds
of prey.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_137'></a>Heaven forbid that such cruel barbarity
should exist. But I cannot pretend
to give you a just account of the
manners and dispositions of these two
people on so slight an acquaintance,
especially as the light in which they
represent each other, is very different
from that in which they appear to us.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nestor's kingdom was in this district. I
have found no antiquities worthy notice;
and time does not permit me to take a
journey in search of Pylos.</p>

<p class='c005'>A small castle projects into the sea off
Modon; and the town has walls round
it; but they are much out of repair.
The Governor lives in a wretched hovel,
which refuses admittance neither to the
wind nor to the rain. He is civil
enough, and all his people seem glad
to see us.</p>

<p class='c005'>The harbour is formed by a set of
little islands, which lie off the town, at
<a id='Page_138'></a>some miles distance; the most western is
the famous Spactaria, the taking of
which is one of the most noted events
in the Peloponnesian war. It is now
called the Isle of Wisdom; but for what
reason I cannot guess, as it is totally
uninhabited, and produces nothing but
brushwood.</p>

<p class='c005'>The passages between the different
islands make this a charming port for
cruizers, since they can be confined
neither by wind nor by an enemy.
Captain Moore, of the Fame privateer,
often put in here during the war, and
has impressed the people with very favorable
ideas of the English.</p>

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Smyrna, November 14th.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>Convinced that you will be happy
to hear of our arrival in Asia, I take
advantage of the first courier to send
you a letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Independent of the satisfaction of being
in a region so noted in history, and
of traversing scenes which one has so
often contemplated in the page of antiquity,
we have the happiness of finding
a society we did not expect in this
lost country--a soil where the iron hand
of Despotism checks every generous
sentiment in the vanquished Greek, and
<a id='Page_140'></a>where the conqueror Turk, proud in
his ignorance, scorns the refinements of
more enlightened people, and looks down
with insolence or contempt on every
nation but his own. He has, however,
many good qualities; and his true character,
I perceive, is not easily delineated.
I shall consider him attentively, and from
time to time send you those traits I discover.
In the mean while, I will conclude
this letter with my Journal from
our leaving Modon to our arrival at
this city.</p>
<p class='c004'>Saturday, October 20th.</p>
<p class='c004'>At eight o'clock this morning, we left
Modon, and, at three in the afternoon,
were opposite Cape Matapan. The country
appears barren; but there are several
villages in sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the night, we entered the Archipelago,
or Ægean Sea, by passing between
Cytherea (the Island of Venus, now called
<a id='Page_141'></a>Serigo) and Cape Angelo, the south-east
point of the Morea.</p>

<p class='c005'>This neighbourhood is inhabited by
a nest of pirates, who call themselves
the real descendants of the Lacedemonians,
and, though subject to the Turks,
acknowledge no law.</p>

<p class='c005'>In calm weather, they come off in
large boats, and plunder every vessel that
passes, but seldom seize on any ship, or
even molest the people, provided they
allow them to take all they want.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is very remarkable, that, although
the French have always a force in these
seas, their vessels are more frequently
plundered than those of any other nation;
and there are very few instances
of ours being insulted, notwithstanding
the Greeks so seldom see a British man
of war.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_142'></a>But, for fear of accidents, we shortened
sail, to convoy the <i>Adventure</i>, of
Plymouth, which we had just overtaken.</p>

<p class='c005'>The three Sclavonians who seized the
<i>Duchess of Tuscany</i>, bound from Gibraltar,
meant to have brought her here,
but being obliged to put into Zante, they
were discovered and executed.</p>
<p class='c004'>Sunday, October 21st.</p>
<p class='c004'>Becalmed in the scene of Falconer's
Shipwreck, Crete just discernible on our
right, Falcanero on our left, and Milo
a-head. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 36° 38′.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>At dusk the wind sprang up, with
violent squalls, accompanied by thunder
and lightning, and soon burst forth in a
furious storm.</p>

<p class='c005'>We were now in a most unpleasant
situation, Milo was become a dangerous
<a id='Page_143'></a>lee shore. It was no comfort to know
that there was an excellent harbour a
few miles to leeward. Darkness prevented
our seeing the entrance to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>We were, therefore, obliged to haul
close to the wind, and by skill, attention,
and perseverance, happily weathered
the most windward point of the
island.</p>

<p class='c005'>The wind then abated, and the sea
became less violent; but the next morning
the storm was suddenly renewed,
and we were assailed more furiously than
ever; but as day-light came to our
assistance, we made the best of our way
towards the harbour, and a pilot getting
on board, we were safe at an anchor before
twelve o'clock.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some centuries before Christ, Milo
was a flourishing Republic, but having
refused its assistance to Greece, when it
<a id='Page_144'></a>was invaded by the Persians, the Athenians,
having defeated the Barbarians,
attacked the Miliotes, and after several
repulses, at last entirely overthrew them,
and as a punishment, all the men who
escaped the sword, were carried into
Attica. But at the close of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 404.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Peloponnesian
war, the Athenians being subdued by the
Lacedemonians, Milo was restored to its
liberty. It was afterwards taken by the
Romans, and has ever since shared the
fate of the Eastern Empire. And for
some centuries the Greeks have been
slaves in a country, from which they
often carried their arms into that of their
present Lords.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whatever the Turk conquers, he immediately
considers as his own, whether
it be land, cattle, men, women, or
children, and instantly appropriates it to
his use, either by sale, exchange, or
possession.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_145'></a>But as an act of grace, the Sultan
grants the Greeks a temporary emancipation
from year to year, for which
they pay an annual capitation tax of
seven shillings each person.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the commencement of this century
the island contained seventeen
churches, and eleven chapels; and the
whole space from the town to the harbour,
which is near two miles, was laid
out in beautiful gardens. But alas! how
wretchedly is it altered, three-fourths of
the towns are in ruins, and the inhabitants
are daily decreasing. Of the gardens
scarce a vestige is left; and the
baths on the water side are now only a
set of small, dirty caves. Eight or ten
yards from the shore the hot spring,
which supplied them, is seen boiling
through the salt water, and the sand is,
I think, still hotter than that of Baia.
But perhaps I speak from the pain my
<a id='Page_146'></a>curiosity cost me being more recent in
my memory.</p>

<p class='c005'>The women, so celebrated for their
beauty, are now sallow, unhealthy, and
disgustingly ugly; and render themselves
still more hideous by their dress, which
is a kind of loose jacket, with a white
cotton petticoat, that scarcely covers two
thirds of their thighs, barely meeting
the stocking above the knee. Their
hind hair hangs down the back in a
number of plaits; that on the fore part
of the head is combed down each side of
the face, and terminated by a small, stiff
curl, which is even with the lower part
of the cheek.</p>

<p class='c005'>All the inhabitants are Greeks; for
the Turks are not fond of trusting themselves
in the small islands; but every
summer the Captain Bashaw goes round
with a squadron to keep them in subjection,
and to collect the revenue.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_147'></a>When the Russians made themselves
masters of the Archipelago, during the
late war, many of the islands declared
in their favour; but being abandoned at
the peace, they were so severely mulcted
by the Grand Signior, that our pilot
tells me, they are determined to remain
perfectly quiet. But as the Turks do
not think them worth a garrison, and
will not trust them with arms and ammunition,
all those which the Russians
may choose to invade, will be obliged to
submit.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two points which form the entrance
of the harbour, crossing each
other, render it imperceptible until you
are close to it. Thus, while you are
perfectly secure within it, you find great
difficulty in getting out, particularly in a
northerly wind. And as no trade is carried
on, except a little in corn and salt, Milo
would scarce ever be visited, were it
not that being the first island one makes
<a id='Page_148'></a>in the Archipelago, the pilots have chosen
it for their residence. They live in
a little town on the top of a high rock,
which, from its situation and appearance,
is called <i>The Castle</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Partridges abound in this island, and
are so cheap, that you may buy one for
a charge of powder only. The peasants
get them by standing behind a portable
screen, with a small aperture in the
center, in which they place the muzzle
of their piece, and then draw the partridge
by a call. When a sufficient
number are collected, they fire among
them, and generally kill from four to
seven at a shot. But even this method
of getting them is so expensive, from
the scarcity of ammunition, that the
people can never afford to shoot them,
but when there are gentlemen in the
island, from whom they can beg a little
powder and shot.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_149'></a>Several of us have killed four or five
in an afternoon walk, putting them up
ourselves, without even the assistance of
a dog.</p>
<p class='c004'>Thursday, October 25th.</p>
<p class='c004'>At day-break we got under way, with
a light breeze, and at midnight anchored
at Paros, another of the Greek
islands, and which is in a much better
state than Milo. The men look more
healthy, and the women not so ugly.</p>

<p class='c005'>The water here is excellent; and as
that we got at Messina has been complained
of, as being too hard to make
proper pease-soup for the people, all the
casks are ordered to be emptied and refilled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst its marble quarries continued
to be worked, Paros was one of the
most flourishing of the Cyclades; but
on the decline of the Eastern Empire,
<a id='Page_150'></a>they were entirely neglected, and are
now converted into caves, in which the
shepherds shelter their flocks. We have
been in several of these subterraneous
folds, which put me much in mind of
Homer's description of Polyphemus.
The common walls are almost entirely
composed of marble; and in examining
a very small part of one, we
found several pieces of cornice, and <i>basso
relievo</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several fine blocks of marble--fragments
of columns, are lying close to the
water's edge, and seem to have been
brought there by travellers, who for
want of a proper purchase to get them
on board, have not been able to carry
them farther.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the battle of Marathon, Miltiades
was sent to lay Paros under contribution,
on account of its joining the
Persians; but the inhabitants made so
<a id='Page_151'></a>resolute a defence, that all the efforts of
that excellent General were unable to
reduce them; and, at length, having lost
a number of his men, and being himself
wounded, Miltiades, hearing that the
Persians were making preparations for a
second invasion, returned to Athens,
where his ungrateful countrymen, forgetful
of his eminent services, sentenced
him to pay the expences of the expedition;
and being unable to raise this
fine, the Great Deliverer of Greece was
thrown into prison; and, to the eternal
infamy of the Athenians, he died of
the wounds he had received in their
service!</p>

<p class='c005'>The Russians made this their grand
arsenal; their powder magazines, and
several other buildings, are still standing,
and the island is considerably indebted
to them for improving the convenience
for water, and for the trade which the
<a id='Page_152'></a>cash they expended, introduced among
the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c005'>Delos is about five leagues off, Naxos
two, and Antiparos about the same
distance. In the last there is a cavern,
which is reckoned one of the greatest
wonders of the Archipelago; but as a
natural curiosity, it is by no means equal
to Saint Michael's Cave at Gibraltar.
A multitude of names are cut near the
entrance. Lady Craven's is among the
latest.</p>
<p class='c004'>Tuesday, October 30th.</p>
<p class='c004'>Sailed from Paros, with an intention
of visiting Delos in our way to Smyrna,
but the wind changing, we stood to
the north-west, profiting by this opportunity,
to supply the ship with wood.</p>
<p class='c004'>Wednesday, October 31st.</p>
<p class='c004'>Anchored between the Island of Longa
and the Coast of Immortal Attica. But
<a id='Page_153'></a>my heart bleeds whilst I survey the sad
change it has undergone. In vain do I
search for the descendants of those rustic
patriots, whose valour enabled Miltiades
and Themistocles to overthrow the
Persian host by sea and land, or for those
well cultivated fields, where art concealed
the frugality of nature. Alas!
far as the best glass can reach, no sign
of a dwelling can be seen; and the
country, for want of inhabitants, lies entirely
neglected.</p>

<p class='c005'>After almost despairing of meeting a
human being, I one day fell in with
two men grazing a considerable number
of horses, which I imagined was a nursery
for the Turkish Cavalry; but on
mentioning this to the Greeks who attended
them, they answered no; that the
only use they were of was to tread out
the corn in summer; in return for which
they grazed them from place to place
in winter. I also found a small chapel,
<a id='Page_154'></a>not bigger than an hermitage, to which
the people from the interior country, on
particular occasions, resort. Part of the
neighbourhood is covered with wood,
which any one may take who chooses
to cut it. Longa, the once celebrated
Island of Helen, is entirely depopulated,
and produces nothing. Our pilot calls
this Port Maundré. It has the same
advantage I remarked at Modon, a passage
at each end of the island.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you can believe that I am within
a day's journey of Athens, how will
you envy my being so near the mother
of the arts and sciences, and what will you
say when I tell you that I did not go
there. But be assured it was not through
want of exertion; but from the impracticability
of getting there by land
in these hostile times. But whilst the
people were wooding, I went in a boat
to the Promontory of Sunium, to see
the remains of the Temple of Minerva,
<a id='Page_155'></a>which I take to be one of the most ancient
remaining in Greece. If we may
credit Homer, it was contemporary with
Troy; for in the third book of the
Odyssey, Nestor, after relating the seduction
of Clytemnestra, passing to the
return of the Greeks, says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"But when to Sunium's sacred point we came,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crown'd with the Temple of the Athenian Dame,</div>
      <div class='line'>Atrides Pilot, Phrontes, there expired, &amp;c."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In some ground lately opened I found
a human scull, and some other burnt
bones. What antiquarian will object
to their being those of this ill-fated
pilot?</p>

<p class='c005'>A considerable part of the architrave
of the Temple is still standing, supported
by fifteen columns, nine of which are
in a row, each nineteen feet high, and
near eleven in circumference. The whole
edifice was of Parian marble. Vast quantities
of fragments and broken columns
<a id='Page_156'></a>are lying all around, and the Temple is
still a beautiful, and a venerable object,
on whatever side you approach the Promontory.</p>
<p class='c004'>November 5th.</p>
<p class='c004'>Got under way at day-light, and having
passed the south point of Negropont
(the ancient Eubœa) and Andros,
were opposite the center of the Island
of Teno at twelve o'clock the next
day. It seems populous and well cultivated.
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lat. 37° 33′.</span> Paros, Delos, and
several other islands in sight.</p>
<p class='c004'>November 7th.</p>
<p class='c004'>We were within a few leagues of Scio
at day-break, and being driven to the
southward, had a distant view of Samos,
the birth place of Juno. We were employed
all this and the next day in working
to windward, between the continent
of Asia Minor and the Island of Scio,
famous for producing the nectar of the
<a id='Page_157'></a>ancients, and for the beauty of its women.
The ladies, I am told, are as
charming as ever, but the wine has lost
its luscious qualities. The town is large
and straggling; it seems to have some
works, but they are in a very sorry condition.
The road is quite open. Before
we reached the town, we passed the bay
of Chisemé, on the Asiatic shore, where
the Turkish fleet was destroyed by the
Russians.</p>
<p class='c004'>Friday, Nov. 9th, 1787.</p>
<p class='c004'>A light breeze sprang up fair late last
night, with which we entered the Gulf

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Smyrna, November 29th.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>Smyrna is the only ancient town
of Asia Minor, that continues to
thrive. It flourished many centuries before
Christ, but was almost destroyed by
an earthquake in the reign of Mark Anthony,
and has never since recovered its
former splendour. For although its advantageous
situation for trade soon drew
new inhabitants, yet, to lessen the effect
of a similar catastrophe, the houses are
all very low. The streets are in general
dirty, narrow, and ill-paved, for the
natives never study regularity in the scite
of their buildings, and the Europeans,
<a id='Page_159'></a>crowding to the water side, found no
room to spare for ornament.</p>

<p class='c005'>The French have the most numerous
factory. The English are next in number
of houses, but the Dutch exceed us
in shipping. The Venetian and Ragusee
vessels are very numerous, but they
are seldom more than carriers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The great advantage England derives
from the trade to this country is, that
the commodities we bring here are home-wrought,
whilst the silk, cotton, and
mohair, with which we are repaid, are
raw articles, that are afterwards manufactured
by ourselves, find work for our
people, and are then exported to different
parts of the world, and some of them
even brought back here.</p>

<p class='c005'>Besides silk and cotton, we take fruit
and drugs, some of which are also re-exported;
but I am sorry to find, that
<a id='Page_160'></a>though our Levant trade is more flourishing
than it has been for many years
past, yet its rise is considerably checked
by our own laws, and by the want of a
regular Lazaretto in England.</p>

<p class='c005'>If there is the least suspicion of the
plague being at Smyrna, no vessel, even
of our own nation, is permitted to discharge
her cargo in Britain, previous
to her having performed a quarantine in
some other part of Europe; for our
Lazarettos do not admit vessels from
infected ports. But since our manufactories
must be supplied with silk and
cotton, our merchants are obliged to
employ the Dutch, who land their goods
in a Lazaretto in Holland, and after a
short quarantine performed there, send
them over to us. Thus do we suffer
foreigners to deprive our seamen of
employment, and our country of its
just profits.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_161'></a>The cause that produces this prejudice
to our Levant Company, is our dread
of the plague. But are we more likely
to be infected by this distemper than the
Dutch? Or is England less able than
Holland to set apart a small place for
a regular Lazaretto? There are innumerable
spots in our island which
might be inclosed for this purpose,
where goods from infected places might
be properly aired, and afterwards introduced
with more safety by our own subjects,
than we at present receive them
from the Dutch.</p>

<p class='c005'>A person who has not been in the
Levant, cannot conceive the inconvenience
and distress arising to our nation,
from this want of a Lazaretto. The
enterprising spirit of the English leads
them every where in search of employment.
A vessel arrives at Smyrna--she
gets a cargo, and the last day of her
loading perhaps the plague appears on
<a id='Page_162'></a>shore. What is she to do? She cannot
sail for England--she must either submit
to a ruinous loss, unload immediately,
and fly to another port in quest
of a freight, or go to one of the Lazarettos
of Italy, France, or Malta, there
perform a quarantine, land and reship
her cargo; and after having, to the prejudice
of the nation, laid out a considerable
sum in a foreign port, she arrives
at Stangate Creek; where, though
the ship perhaps is not long detained,
the cargo is put into one of the hulks,
and aired with greater care and length
of time, than the cotton has been which
we receive without any apprehension
from Holland.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. <span class='small'>The Author since his return to England, has
been at Stangate Creek, where he found that cotton,
and other enumerated goods brought over
from Holland, now undergo a similar process to
those, which, after having performed a quarantine
in a foreign Lazaretto, are brought home by the
English. But still the inconvenience to our own
people is not lessened, nor ever will, till we have
a complete Lazaretto of our own.</span></p>

</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_163'></a>That precautions are necessary nobody
will deny; but why should we shackle
our own people more than the Dutch?
Or why should we be more afraid of
allowing goods from an infected place
to be landed in one of the many waste
spots of Kent, Essex, Devonshire, or
Cornwall, than foreigners are of receiving
them at the very gates of their
capital cities. I shall write you a long
letter on this subject, when I have
gained more experience in the nature of
the plague, which I can already assure
you is by no means so dangerous a
distemper as Europeans imagine it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The factory have great hopes that the
generous Philanthrope, who lately visited
Asia, will interest himself in their
favour. This amiable patriot knows that</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_164'></a>the navy is the bulwark of Britain, and
that whatever tends to decrease the number
of our seamen, tends to diminish the
strength of our country; a truth so
interesting to an Englishman, that I hope
to God the accounts I hear of a most
alarming decrease in our Greenlandmen
are much exaggerated. A proper Lazaretto
in England, by increasing our shipping
in the Levant, would afford a sustenance
to many of those invaluable subjects,
whom a perhaps too rigid public
œconomy has bereft of bread.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are many inconveniencies attending
a correspondence between this
country and Europe. The post sets
out and arrives but twice a month. It
goes through Constantinople and Vienna,
and unless letters to and from England
are taken up, and paid for at each of
those places, they will never reach
their destination. The want of a more
<a id='Page_165'></a>regular communication must be sensibly
felt in a place of so much trade.</p>

<p class='c005'>We found near one hundred sail of
merchantmen in the bay, every one of
whom saluted us; for, to raise the
European Powers in the eyes of the
Turks, it is the custom at Smyrna to
salute every man of war that enters the
port. The same ceremony was performed
on our going on shore the next
day; and, as soon as we landed at
Mr. Hayes', we were waited upon by
the Consuls and Factories of the different
nations, who have given us the
most flattering reception. Scarce an
evening passes without a ball or a concert,
or some other party, for our
amusement: but I am much surprised
at the excessive dread in which the
Christians live of their fellow subjects,
the Mahometans. They dwell in separate
districts, and are as fearful of going
promiscuously among them, as into a
<a id='Page_166'></a>den of wild beasts. The Turks have,
indeed, a lordly, imperious air, which
I suppose they acquire from the abject
manner of the Greeks, who, being a
conquered people, are always suspected
of rebellious intentions, and almost extirpated
on the least appearance of an
insurrection; which obliges them to
crouch so much to the conquerors, that
they imagine all other Christians equally
dastardly, and hold us in the same light
as we do the Jews--a mean, money-making,
unbelieving sect: but I am convinced,
that if we went more among
them, we should hear of fewer insults.
I was so confident of this, that, without
mentioning my intentions, I set out,
and, after walking round the Turkish
town, struck down through its very
center, without meeting any interruption,
except from one man, who, pointing
at me, called out <i>Bah!</i> and two or
three boys, who threw stones, but who
were immediately called in by their
<a id='Page_167'></a>father. I doubt whether a foreigner, in
a strange dress, would pass through
London with so little molestation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nevertheless, like the Jews in England,
there have been instances here of the
Christians being most inhumanly massacred;
but this has never happened but
after some signal disaster to the Turks,
to which they supposed they had contributed;
such as the destruction of their
fleet in the Chisemé, which they knew
the Russians could not have effected
without the assistance of other powers;
and the rabble make very little distinction
of nations, confounding all Europeans
together, under the appellation
of Franks.</p>

<p class='c005'>The poor Greeks complain much of
their cruelty and oppression; but, in
points of honour, our merchants tell me
no people are stricter than the Turks.
In other respects, the reports they give
<a id='Page_168'></a>of their laws and customs, vary so
much, that it is impossible for a stranger,
as I am, and ignorant of the language of
the country, to send you a more perfect
account.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'> LETTER. XVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</p>
<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Smyrna, December 31st.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>The Empress of Russia's late journey
to the Crimea, and the confederacy
formed there by her Majesty and the
Emperor of Germany, have given the
late stroke to those reiterated provocations
which would, long ere this, have
excited to arms a people less irascible
than the Turks: but, however inclined
the nation at large might be to resent
the insults of the Russians, and the frequent
infringements of the Treaty of
Cainardgie, yet their fiery spirit was
kept in awe by the pacific disposition
of the reigning Sultan.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_170'></a>Abdoul Hamet is a Prince of a humane
and virtuous character; and, although
the peace of 1774 was forced upon his
country, he determined most religiously
to adhere to the conditions it imposed.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the time this treaty was concluded,
the Porte was in a most deplorable state,
to which it was in a great measure reduced
by the unprecedented support the
English afforded to the ambitious views
of the Court of Petersburg, against a
nation with whom we were at peace.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Spaniards were well inclined to
prevent the Russian fleet entering the Mediterranean;
but their objections were
quashed at once by the interference of so
brilliant a Power as England: a Power
whose all-conquering force the Court of
Spain had so recently felt, in the repeated
victories of the immortal Chatham,
which had obliged her to supplicate peace
at the feet of our glorious Sovereign.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_171'></a>A George, and a Chatham, are names
which the patriotic Englishman could
for ever dwell upon; but both the politics
of the one, and the virtues of the other,
are too exalted to be extended by a
panegyric from my humble pen. To return,
then, to the Turks, and to a time
when, I am sorry to say, our prejudice in
favor of Russia, made us adopt a line of
conduct in a high degree contrary to
but own interest: The terror of the
English having compelled the Spaniards
to suffer the Russians to enter the
Mediterranean, our port at Mahon immediately
received them with open arms.
Here they were not only supplied with
every refreshment, but our hospitals, nay,
even our arsenals, were opened to them,
and every encouragement was given to
our officers and seamen, to enter into
their service.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus supplied and equipped, the
Russian fleet sailed for the Archipelago,
<a id='Page_172'></a>and gave battle to the Turks. Victory
(as may naturally be supposed, from the
superior abilities and nautical experience
of Commodore Elphinstone and the
British officers) declared for the Russians.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Ottoman fleet retired to the Bay
of Chisemé; and the Moscovites, unaccustomed
to naval exertions, were not
disposed to pursue their advantage. It
was with the utmost difficulty that Commodore
Elphinstone could persuade them
to follow the enemy, and attack him in
port: but at length, by threats and entreaties,
having stimulated them to this
enterprize, he led them to the Chisemé
the ensuing night. The Turks, astonished
at the unexpected attack, were instantly
panic-struck, and, without any shew of
defence, abandoned and set fire to their
ships.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus did an Englishman give a fatal
blow to the Turkish empire--a blow
<a id='Page_173'></a>from which I much doubt whether the
Porte will ever recover.</p>

<p class='c005'>Commodore Elphinstone instantly
pushed for the Dardanelles, and, by
guarding the entrance of those straits,
cut off all communication by sea between
Constantinople and the southern
provinces. The capital was streightened
for provisions; Egypt revolted, and
most of the Greek islands joined the
Russians.</p>

<p class='c005'>These were the first consequences of
the disaster at Chisemé; and every day
brought on others still more distressing
to the Porte.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Russian fleet, now unopposed,
was enabled to attack every part of the
Turkish coast in the Adriatic, the Archipelago,
and the Mediterranean; and,
although the troops they had on board
were but few, yet, from the facility with
<a id='Page_174'></a>which they were transported from place
to place, the Turks were obliged to detach
a very large part of their grand
army to oppose their different attacks.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this was not all. Many of the
soldiers employed to the north, were
volunteers from the southern provinces,
who, hearing that their own homes were
attacked, deserted in large corps. These
desertions, and the detachments sent to
the south, weakened and discouraged
the northern army so much, that the
Russians gained repeated victories, and
at last compelled the Porte to sue for
peace.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Treaty of Cainardgie was highly
humiliating in itself, and was rendered
still more so by the haughty manner of
the Russians, which seemed entirely
calculated to provoke the Turks to hostilities,
in which they have at last succeeded.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_175'></a>Monsieur Bulgakow, the Russian Envoy,
who had been sent for by the
Empress, to assist at the conferences between
her Majesty and the Emperor of
Germany, and probably to give the
Confederate Powers information of the
disposition, and the measures most likely
to be pursued by the Porte, had no
sooner returned to Constantinople, than
the Turkish Ministry, convinced of the
oppressive and aspiring views of the
Court of Petersburgh, made the Envoy
a formal representation of the many causes
of complaint his Court had given to the
Porte.</p>

<p class='c005'>This representation was followed by
a second; but the Envoy, in conformity,
I suppose, to the plan agreed upon at
Cherson, gave no manner of satisfaction,
and the hostile views of his Court becoming
every day more notorious, the
Porte summoned him to a conference
on the 16th of August, and there demanded
<a id='Page_176'></a>a categorical explanation of the
intentions of the Empress towards the
Turks.</p>

<p class='c005'>M. Bulgakow's answers appearing vague
and unsatisfactory, the Divan determined
to have recourse to arms, and in
conformity to the Turkish custom on
such occasions, the Envoy, with part
of his suite and attendants, were sent to
the Seven Towers, where, though state
prisoners, they have every indulgence
but liberty. And such is the pacific
disposition of the Sultan, that he declares
his only motive in going to war,
is to inforce the conditions imposed by
the Treaty of Cainardgie--a treaty,
which, though the most disadvantageous
the Turks ever signed, he declares himself
still ready to renew.</p>

<p class='c005'>The manifesto published by the Porte
states, that ever since the year 1774,
the Court of Russia has been constantly
<a id='Page_177'></a>infringing the Treaty of Cainardgie, and
disturbing the harmony which that treaty
was intended to secure. That she has
even seized on the Crimea, and raised up
Prince Heraclius, who was an acknowledged
vassal of the Porte. That not
content with endeavouring to drive the
Oczakowians from their own salt-pans,
and many other attacks, she proceeded
so far as to order her Envoy to make a
demand of several dangerous and humiliating
concessions from the Porte, and
to threaten, that in case of a refusal,
Prince Potemkin, with 70,000 men, had
orders to advance to the frontiers. That
since the Porte could not with any safety
agree to these conditions, she was obliged
to declare war. And submits her
motives to the equity of her friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>So vigorous a step was not immediately
expected by the Empress; and
had the Turks been in any degree prepared
for the hostile measures they were
<a id='Page_178'></a>compelled to adopt, the surprise in which
they took the Russians, would probably
have given them a decisive advantage.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fact is, the Court of Petersburgh
did not expect hostilities to commence
before the ensuing spring, and the Turks
never thought of them till M. Bulgakow's
return from the Crimea. Thus both
parties were equally surprised.</p>

<p class='c005'>The season was too far advanced for
the Grand Vizir to take the field. Those
troops, however, that could be collected
on the frontiers, immediately began to
act, and in different recounters with
the Russians, have been generally victorious.</p>

<p class='c005'>No enterprize, however, of any moment
has as yet been undertaken by the
Turks, except an attack upon Kimbourn.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_179'></a>This fortress is situated on the Russian
side of the Liman, or mouth of the
Dnieper, exactly opposite to Oczakow,
and from its situation is of the first importance.
The Porte therefore ordered
an immediate attempt to carry it by a
coup-de-main. A detachment from
Oczakow was accordingly landed in the
night of the 11th of October, and carried
all before them till they arrived at
the very scarp of the fort; but by this
time the Russians had recovered their
surprise, and the Turks, from the nature
of the enterprise, being unprepared to
attempt a regular escalade against a garrison
whose numbers they found were
very little inferior to their own, were
obliged to retreat.</p>

<p class='c005'>The loss on each side was nearly equal,
and on the part of the Russians, M.
Souwarow and M. Reck, two generals
of note, were both severely wounded.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_180'></a>The Court of Petersburgh, however,
has great reason to rejoice at this escape,
since had Kimbourn been carried, none
of her vessels could have entered the
Liman till it was retaken, which probably
would not have happened this
year, and consequently, should the Porte
even choose to act on the defensive in
the spring, the Russians would still be
obliged to begin the ensuing campaign
with a siege in their own country.</p>

<p class='c005'>Count Romanzow, with an army, has
entered Polish Russia, but the season was
too far advanced for him to attempt any
active operations, I have not heard any
thing else of importance on the land side;
but in the naval line, fortune has struck
a capital blow in favor of the Turks.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little fleet the Empress had, with
great difficulty, collected on the Black
Sea has been entirely dispersed and dismasted,
and a line of battle ship, of
<a id='Page_181'></a>sixty-four guns, commanded by Captain
Teesdale, to avoid being wrecked, was
obliged to push for Constantinople, and
give herself up to the Turks.</p>

<p class='c005'>As she is very little damaged, she will
sail in the spring, under the banners of
the Porte. The Russians were before
very inferior to the Turks on the Black
Sea; and the loss of one ship to them
making a difference of two in favor of
their enemies, renders their inequality
still more desperate.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Turks having no idea of prisoners
on parole, the Russian Captain is sent to
associate with the Envoy in the Castle of
the Seven Towers. The rest of the
ship's company are disposed of in the
Bagnio.</p>

<p class='c005'>Notwithstanding our impolitic ill
usage, so fatal to the Turks during the last
Russian war, I think we are the favorite
<a id='Page_182'></a>nation of such of them as are at all
acquainted with the different powers of
Europe: I say, impolitic ill usage, because,
depend upon it, the very extensive
Empire of Turkey will never be in
hands so beneficial to England, as whilst
it remains in those of its present possessors.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Turks, happily for us, are not a
commercial people, notwithstanding their
Empire has every advantage to induce
them to become so. We cannot do without
those valuable articles which their soil
produces almost spontaneously; and the
Turk, like the easy possessor of a very
rich mine, allows us to enrich ourselves
at our pleasure. Three per cent. duty
equally on all exports and imports, is,
with little exception, their only restriction
to Europeans engaged in their trade.</p>

<p class='c005'>Would the Empress be equally moderate,
if in possession of this fertile region?
<a id='Page_183'></a>Believe me she would not. As
several of our manufactures could not be
carried on without her productions, she
would only give them on her own terms.
Perhaps only in her own bottoms. All
her politics would be directed to increase
her trade and shipping, and consequently
her naval force; and, thus inclined,
with such a country, she would soon rise
to a maritime power much beyond what
the world has ever experienced. We
have only to look to Tyre, to Rhodes,
and many other places scarce bigger than
specks on the map of Turkey, to conceive
what a force might arise from this
immense, this all producing Empire.</p>

<p class='c005'>In its present state, Turkey, as I have
already hinted, may be compared to a
rich mine, to which the industrious from
every nation have free access. In the
hands of the Empress it would be like
the barred treasure of an ambitious Lord,
never to be opened but to be increased.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_184'></a>In this I do not mean to reflect on her
Imperial Majesty, since, I fancy, every
European power, in a similar situation,
would act the same part. I only desire
to evince that England will never derive
such advantages from Turkey, as whilst
it remains in the hands of the Ottomans,
and consequently that it is our interest, as
well as that of every other nation that does
not expect a share in the partition of the
Turkish Empire, to break the confederacy
between the Empress of Russia and
the Emperor of Germany, and check
the progress of the two Imperial Courts.
I mention the Emperor, because, though
he has not yet declared war, it is very
well known that he is bound, both by
treaty and inclination, to assist the
Russians.</p>

<p class='c005'>The French Court very wisely, in the
last war, supported the Porte; but from
the indifference with which she now
beholds the threatened ruin of a power
<a id='Page_185'></a>with whom she trades to so much advantage,
a rumour gains ground that
she has been brought over to the ambitious
views of the Imperial Courts,
by the promise, that should their designs
succeed, Egypt and the Island of
Candia shall be given to France.</p>

<p class='c005'>Should this ever happen, England may
bid adieu to the trade of the Levant,
and, in a short time, by the easy communication
the French will establish with
the East-Indies, by the way of the Isthmus
of Suez, they will give a fatal blow to
our India trade also.</p>

<p class='c005'>To prevent these schemes from succeeding,
our first object is to countenance
the Spaniards in opposing the entrance
of the Russian fleet into the
Mediterranean; since, if the Turks can
bring their whole force to act towards
the north, I do not think, now that
their fleet has such a decided superiority
<a id='Page_186'></a>on the Black Sea, that they have much
to fear in the present state of Europe.
The King of Sweden, were he countenanced,
is well disposed to take an open
part in their favour; and this countenance
the King of Prussia will undoubtedly
afford him.</p>

<p class='c005'>As to Europe's having any thing to
dread from the Turks extending their
conquest, the idea is absurd. Their
Empire is already larger than they well
can keep in order; and, from the nature
of their government, the more
they extend it, the more will it be
weakened. Their army may make irruptions,
but must soon return to its
proper bounds.</p>

<p class='c005'>They do not, like the Romans, incorporate
the vanquished with the conquerors,
so as, in time, to become one
people, and to increase in numbers as
they increase in territory. On the
<a id='Page_187'></a>contrary, the farther the Turk advances
in Europe, the more he augments
the number of his rebellious subjects,
and by dispersing, he weakens his own.</p>

<p class='c005'>Constantinople excluded, the Grand
Signior's subjects in Europe are computed
at eight Greeks to one Turk.
Totally different in language, manners,
and religion, a natural antipathy is
bred between them. The Turk spurns
the Greek as an impious dastard. The
Greek, urged by revenge, is ever ripe
for a revolt, and ready to join the first
invaders.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we consider this striking circumstance,
and the success of the Russians
in the last war, it may be imagined,
that on the Emperor's taking the field,
the Turks will very soon be driven out
of Europe; and of this our factory
here are in the highest apprehension.
But we must at the same time recollect,
<a id='Page_188'></a>that it was England who gave force
to Russia, in the manner I before related,
and that this force, if it does not now
oppose her, will, at least, not operate in
her favor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Monsieur St. Felix arrived here lately
with a squadron of frigates and
sloops, eight in number. The Governor
immediately sent to the French
Consul to know the meaning of so many
men of war coming to this port. M.
Amoreux answered, that they only came
in for refreshments. Whether or not
it was in consequence of this message, I
cannot take upon me to affirm, but the
majority of the French squadron put
to sea in the course of the two following
days. This, I think, confirms that
a jealousy of France exists in the minds
of the Turks.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Smyrna, January 15th, 1788.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND,</span></p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>To gain some little knowledge of the
interior country, and, at the same
time, to pay a compliment to St. Paul,
we took a journey by land to Ephesus,
the inhabitants of which, you may remember,
were honoured with an Epistle
from him, and with having his son
Timothy for a Bishop. It is barely
forty miles from hence; but the Turks
never going beyond a foot pace in travelling,
we made it a journey of two
days. We had six horses for ourselves,
and as many for our guides, janizary,
and servants. We were obliged to
<a id='Page_190'></a>carry all our provisions with us, even
bread. Water we found in abundance;
and such is the attention of the Turks
to this valuable article of life, that we
came to several excellent fountains when
there was nothing like an habitation to
be seen. The greater part of the road
is execrably bad; and the country,
though in general fertile, is too thinly
peopled to be much cultivated.</p>

<p class='c005'>The few inhabitants we saw in the
second day's journey were wretchedly
poor. You recollect that this is the
freezing month of January, and that
the winter here, though short, is, for
a few weeks, much more severe than one
would expect in so southern a latitude.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our road led us by a fountain, where,
in this cold weather, some women were
washing. None of them were completely
clothed; and one poor girl had,
for her only covering, a piece of an old
<a id='Page_191'></a>blanket, with two holes torn in the upper
end of it, through which, instead of
sleeves, she put her arms. It was too
small to cover her chest, too short to
reach below her waist; and it was with
difficulty that, by holding the lower
corners in her two hands, she made them
meet.</p>

<p class='c005'>A young female, in an attire so little
adapted to the tenderness of her sex, and
to the inclemency of the season, moved
one's very soul. I do not know that
I touched the reins, and yet my horse
stopt with his head towards her. My
eye involuntarily fixed itself upon her;
and, to the latest moment of my life,
I shall never forget her figure. She is
above the middle size, and her limbs did
not seem formed for so exposed a situation.
The sun had tanned her face; but
her skin was smooth, and naturally delicate,
and her features of that mould,
that, had she been born to a more happy
<a id='Page_192'></a>lot, she might have been reckoned a perfect
beauty.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was impossible to behold such an
object without emotion. My horse now
advanced to her feet, and my friend approached
her at the same moment. Each
searched his pockets, and presented the
little silver they contained. No hand
could be spared to receive it. In our
anxiety to relieve her distress, we had
forgot the trial to which we had exposed
her modesty. The blushing maid stood
motionless; but, encouraged by the sympathy
and charity marked in our approach,
she ventured to raise her head.--Her
eyes were turned towards us.--The
tear of gratitude was swelling in them.--She
gave but one glance.--Her face was
instantly reverted to the ground.--She
could not speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such unexpected modesty, in so exposed
a situation, filled me with astonishment
<a id='Page_193'></a>and veneration. How much did I
wish to take her in my arms, and, by
a kiss of affection, to express the sympathy
I bore in her distress. How did I
execrate the parsimony that had prevented
my having about me all the
money I possessed.--How earnestly did I
wish to remove her to a more sheltered
fate, where her beauty and her modesty
might be better known and admired.</p>

<p class='c005'>Led away by these inclinations, I was
preparing to alight. The timid virgin
drew back. By signs of respect, she
again raised her eyes. Charity was so
forcibly petitioning in them, that the
money which her figure at first sight
drew from my pocket, now dropt at her
feet. The reins fell from my hand. My
horse inclined to the road. I would
with joy have turned him back; but I
recollected my inability to relieve her.--I
am only a Soldier of Fortune, and
subsist but by the bounty of my Sovereign:
<a id='Page_194'></a>a bounty which, though much
superior to what my humble services
entitle me to expect, is, alas! too insufficient
to support the appearance required
from an Officer, and often compels
the military Philanthrope to suppress
every charitable emotion.</p>

<p class='c005'>The road being but little frequented,
the caravansera, or public inn, we stopped
at the first night of our journey, was
nothing but a large hovel, one end of
which was appropriated to travellers,
and the other, without any partition, to
their cattle: but we were fortunate
enough to be accommodated with a
Greek hut, where, with the assistance of
a good fire, we passed a tolerable night.</p>

<p class='c005'>At Ephesus we were not so lucky.
We were obliged to sleep promiscuously
among the Turks, one or other of whom
was smoking all night long. I observed
that they eat very little, but that, after
<a id='Page_195'></a>every nap, they took a pipe, and a sip
of coffee: I say, a sip; for the Turkish
cups are scarce bigger than a walnut
shell; but of these they drink an amazing
number, and their coffee is always exceedingly
strong.</p>

<p class='c005'>We were heartily rejoiced when we
returned to our old Greek hut on the
road, but, to our great disappointment,
found it possessed by a Turk. Luckily,
he expressed a great desire to taste our
beer; and we seized this opportunity to
get rid of him, by desiring our janizary
to invite him to partake of a bottle of it
at the caravansera. A janizary's invitation
is only a civil command; but we
did not choose to make use of his
authority until we could give the Turk a
satisfactory compensation. Mahomet forbade
the use of wine; but his followers
do not conceive themselves to be prohibited
the use of other fermented liquors.
In general, they are very fond of porter
<a id='Page_196'></a>and beer of all kinds, drinking as much
of it as they can get; and some of them,
indeed, are not very scrupulous about
wine.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the Turk was gone, not dreaming
of the danger that was hanging over
us, we slept very comfortably for some
hours; but, before day-light, we were
roused by flakes of fire falling upon our
bodies from the roof. No water being
at hand, the whole hut was soon in a
blaze, and, in a few minutes, burnt to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>This unlucky accident was occasioned
by our own fire, which heated the mud
flue that served as a chimney, to such a
degree, that it communicated to the
thatched roof, which was half burnt
through before we awoke. Very fortunately,
none of us had taken off our
clothes; for we carried no bedding, and
nothing of the kind was to be got.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_197'></a>The Turks in the Caravansera remained
quiet spectators of this catastrophe.
At the moment when we
found that all our efforts to extinguish
the flames were ineffectual, my eye turning
towards the Mussulmen, found them
smoking, and seemingly quite unconcerned.</p>

<p class='c005'>Determined not to be outdone by
them in coolness, I seated myself in the
middle of them, and, being provided
with the materials, instantly began
shaving myself, to their no small astonishment,
and the equal delight of the
boys of our party, who have turned
this anecdote into a pleasant story,
which is my only reason for mentioning
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>You of course recollect that the Temple
of Diana at Ephesus, which was one
of the wonders of the world, was destroyed
<a id='Page_198'></a>on the very day that Alexander was born,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 356<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> by a sacrilegious
wretch, to render himself remembered by
posterity. We found many ruins, and among
the rest, a superb pile quite overturned,
which we concluded was the remains of this
celebrated temple. The columns were all
broken. The most entire piece was
forty-two feet in length, and eighteen
in circumference. This and the rest of
the columns, were every one hewn out of
single blocks of marble; but notwithstanding
the immense size and value of these materials
several antiquarians will not allow them to
have belonged to the real Temple of Diana.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is not my purpose to dispute with
these learned gentlemen, I shall only
observe, that none of them have made
the columns of this Temple more than
sixty feet high.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_199'></a>According to Palladio's measurement
of the pillars to the portico of the celebrated
Rotunda at Rome, which has
universally been accepted as a proper
standard, the height of the Corinthian
column is twenty modules.</p>

<p class='c005'>A circumference of eighteen feet gives
a module of three feet, and in common
arithmetic, twenty of these give sixty.
On these proportions then, the fragment
I mention formed a column of the exact
height handed down to us of those of the
Temple of Diana.</p>

<p class='c005'>But people who wish to diminish the
consequence of the pile I am mentioning,
may say that Palladio's proportions
are liable to exceptions, which I will
readily admit, that I may ask, whether
it is possible, by any proportions, to
make a column less than sixty feet high
of a base and capital, in addition to a
<a id='Page_200'></a>shaft, a fragment of which is forty-two
feet in length?</p>

<p class='c005'>If either of the positions I take up be
admitted, those antiquarians who will
not allow this magnificent pile of ruins
to have belonged to the Temple of Diana,
must at least confess, that these superb
fragments must have formed an edifice
equal to it, both in size and grandeur.</p>

<p class='c005'>We also saw the remains of St. John's
Church, now converted into a Turkish
Mosque. Part of the aqueduct, and
many other vestiges of the once noble
city of Ephesus, are still to be seen.
But in lieu of the Blessed Virgin, St.
Paul, St. John, Kings, Princes, and Heroes,
who rendered it so famous, both
in sacred and profane history, its inhabitants
are now reduced to a few miserable
peasants.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_201'></a>We met no manner of interruption
on the road, notwithstanding this is a
time when the Government, naturally
weak, is obliged to suffer a kind of licentiousness,
in order to keep the rabble
in good humour, and to complete the
new levies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Never was there a more popular war
than the present. The Turks, from
every part of this immense Empire, are
preparing to join the grand army. The
suspicions against the Emperor of Germany
increase every day; but from the
zeal and spirit with which every Mussulman
enters into the cause, one is almost
led to imagine, that the Ottomans will
make a tolerable stand against the powerful
enemies by which they will be attacked.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is fortunate for the Porte, that at
this crisis her Ministers are avowedly the
best that ever governed Turkey. The
<a id='Page_202'></a>Grand Vizir is young and vigorous, and
a pupil of the celebrated Hassan, now
Captain Bashaw, or Lord High Admiral,
who is just returned from Egypt crowned
with victory. He had been sent
there with the fleet, and an army also
under his command, to subdue the rebel
Beys, in which, notwithstanding the
intrigues of the Russians, he happily
succeeded, and, by additional proofs of
courage and address, has added fresh
laurels to his former fame.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Vice-Admiral, who commanded
at Constantinople in his absence, was
sent to destroy six Russian men of war,
which being dismasted in the storm that
had obliged Captain Teesdale to give
himself up to the Turks, had anchored
on the coast of the Black Sea, and seemed
to promise an easy conquest. But, to
the great disappointment of the Porte,
they had time to refit and get off; and
as their escaping was said to be owing
<a id='Page_203'></a>to want of exertion in the Turkish Vice-Admiral,
he was banished immediately
after his return to Constantinople, and
afterwards brought back and beheaded.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Captain Bashaw is equipping the
fleet with all possible dispatch, and will
sail early in the spring, with a force
that will compel the Russian squadron
on the Black Sea to act on the defensive,
unless their fleet from the Baltic is permitted
to enter the Mediterranean, and
make a diversion to the southward. But
as this would be entirely depriving the
Porte of every prospect of opposing,
with any success, the machinations of
her enemies, England certainly can never
permit so decisive a step to be taken
in favor of the ambitious, and to us,
destructive views of the two Imperial
Courts.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Reis Effendi, or Principal Secretary
of State, is said to possess sufficient
<a id='Page_204'></a>abilities to fill that office in any country
in Europe. The following anecdote of
him, will give you an idea of his opinion
of France and England. The
spirited conduct of our Court during
the late disturbances in Holland, reflects
the greatest honor on the King and his
Ministers; and it is said, that Sir Robert
Ainslie, our Ambassador at the Porte,
with his usual patriotic attention to the
honor and interest of his country, drew
up a short narrative of that important
business, and delivered it to the Porte.</p>

<p class='c005'>At an audience afterwards given to
Sir Robert, the Turkish Ministry congratulated
his Excellency on the distinguished
success of his Court, and the
Reis Effendi, I am told, made these observations,
"You have acted with all
your usual courage--but with more
than your usual wisdom. You have
carried your point without bloodshed,
<a id='Page_205'></a>and have left the French to fight among
themselves."</p>

<p class='c005'>The last sentence occasioned some surprise;
but by what I learn from the
French officers who are just arrived, a
violent convulsion in France is not far
distant, and the Reis Effendi bids fair
to prove by it, his profound knowledge
of the interior state of that kingdom,
a knowledge which Turkish Ministers are
not generally expected to possess, at least
of nations that are not their immediate
neighbours.</p>

<p class='c005'>An army of observation is forming
on the Banks of the Danube, to watch
the motions of the Germans, whose
hostile declaration is hourly expected.
The Baron de Herbert has given himself
great airs in the Divan, and threatened
vengeance on the Porte, for daring to
attack the ally of the Emperor, his
master. The Turks treated these threats
<a id='Page_206'></a>with the contempt such impertinence
deserved; but at the same time, with
great gravity and wisdom, they informed
the Baron, that they were aware of the
power of the Emperor, and would be
sorry to see it exerted against them; but
still that, trusting to the equity of Europe,
they were determined to risk this
unequal conflict, rather than submit to
those incessant encroachments, which,
by daily weakening the Porte, and increasing
the power of the two Imperial
Courts, must end, if unopposed, in the
total subversion of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Emperor seems convinced that
threats will not avail, and even at this
late season, daily accounts arrive of the
march of his troops towards the frontiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Constant skirmishes are happening between
the Turks and the Russians on the
<a id='Page_207'></a>borders of the Crimea; and since my
last letter, the Porte have received information
of the capture of twelve hundred
Russians, and of the Island of
Taman being taken by the Tartars of
Kuban. The possession of this island
is of great consequence to the Turks,
since it forms the east side of the straits
of Wosphor Zabach, which connect
the Black Sea with the sea of Azof.</p>

<p class='c005'>To balance this success, the French,
and other enemies of the Porte, give
out that a General Sekell, with a corps
of Russians, has routed a detachment of
these same Tartars, in the vicinity of
Mount Caucasus. The season, however,
is too far advanced for any thing decisive
to be done.</p>

<p class='c005'>In April the Grand Vizir will take the
field in earnest; but in the mean while
the Moscovite troops are gathering
towards Turkey, on the banks of the
<a id='Page_208'></a>Dnieper, the Bog, and the Dniester;
and if the Emperor engages the attention
of the Ottoman grand army, the
Russian Generals will begin the ensuing
campaign with the siege of Oczakow,
and the invasion of Moldavia. Prince
Potemkin will direct the former, Count
Romanzow the latter; and unless some
other power interferes, it is not difficult
to foresee, that the Imperial Courts will
soon accomplish all their ambitious
schemes against this brave, but unenlightened
people.</p>

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Athens, Jan. 29th, 1788.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>We took leave of our Smyrna friends
on the 19th of January, and
having passed Scio, Lesbos, and Ipsera,
were off Scyros on the 21st. We
wished to visit this island, because it
contains the tomb of Theseus, who killed
the monster of Crete, and carried off
the beauteous Ariadne; but the wind
not permitting us to fetch it, we continued
our course by Negropont, Longa,
and the Promontory of Sunium. But
the next morning the wind blew so strong
against us, that finding it in vain to oppose
it, we crossed the Sinus Sironicus,
<a id='Page_210'></a>and anchored among the little islands of
Idra. The weather continued bad for
three days; it drove all the wild fowl
to the shore, and afforded us excellent
shooting, which compensated our
delay.</p>

<p class='c005'> On the 25th we again got under way,
and the day after entered the Pyræus,
the port of this celebrated city. What
emotion must one feel on entering the
ruins of a capital, which, from a small
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 1556.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> village, first
formed into a regular government by
Cecrops, became so flourishing, and so
populous a state, that its citizens alone,
in the famous battle of Marathon, delivered
all Greece from the yoke of the Persians.</p>

<p class='c005'>Xerxes was so little discouraged by the
misfortunes of his father, that the
moment he ascended his throne, he
determined to make a second attempt. His
<a id='Page_211'></a>army is said to have exceeded a million
of men; and the number of his fleet was
in proportion to the multitude of his
troops. On his entering Upper Greece,
most of the states, intimidated by the
immensity of his armament, submitted
to the enemy. The Peloponnesians having
the advantage of inhabiting a country
almost an island, and only assailable
at the narrow Isthmus of Corinth,
etermined to defend themselves.
Themistocles infused the same spirit
into the Athenians, and promoted the
recall of his rival, Aristides. Their
allies thinking it in vain to oppose
the Persians beyond the Peloponnesus,
wished all their forces to retire within
the Isthmus. But the Athenians, encouraged
by their former victory, bravely resolved
once more to become the champions of Greece,
and oppose the enemy before he entered Attica.
<a id='Page_212'></a>Having brought the allies into this resolution,
a detachment under Leonidas, King of Sparta,
took possession of the pass of Thermopylæ,
and for some time supported themselves against
all the efforts of Xerxes, and his innumerable
host. But a secret path being treacherously
discovered to the enemy, Leonidas was surprised
in the morning by seeing the Persians in
possession of the heights above him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Xerxes had now gained a decisive
advantage; but the laws of Sparta not
permitting its citizens to retreat, Leonidas
sent back all his detachment, except
three hundred, who were natives of
that city. With these he devoted himself
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 480.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to the service
of his country, and falling upon the
invaders, made a prodigious slaughter
among them; but fresh numbers
continually supplying the place of the
slain, this great and gallant Prince
<a id='Page_213'></a>was at last overpowered, and died with
his heroic associates, in the midst of
thousands of their enemies.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this juncture, the Athenians consulted
the Oracle, and were desired to
trust to their wooden walls. Themistocles
persuaded all those who were capable
of bearing arms to embark in the
fleet; the women and children were
removed; and the town, abandoned to
the enemy, fell a prey to the barbarians.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fleet was assembled in the straits,
within the Island of Salamis. Xerxes,
who already talked of nothing but of
extirpating the Greeks, by seizing their
ships, flattered himself that he had now
an opportunity of destroying them all
at one blow. He therefore rashly attacked
them in this narrow pass; but
he soon found the superiority of the
Grecian Admirals, who, by the excellence
<a id='Page_214'></a>of their disposition, brought a
much greater number of ships into action
than the Persians could oppose at one
time. Their van was of course defeated,
which threw a general panick into the
barbarians, and ended in a complete
victory on the side of the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Persian King, who beheld the
battle of Salamis from a neighbouring
height, finding himself unable to support
his immense army, after the loss
of his fleet, retreated with the utmost
precipitation. But before he quitted
Greece, he gave Mardonius the command
of a large detachment, to secure
part of his conquests; but these being
some months afterwards entirely defeated
by Pausanias and Aristides at
Platæa, and most of the troops the King
carried with him having perished in the
retreat, the Grecians pursued him into
Asia.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_215'></a>Athens now rose, by rapid strides, to
its highest lustre. Themistocles augmented
the navy, rebuilt the city, fortified
the Pyræus, and joined it to the
town, which is four miles distant, by
a strong fortified wall. His grand object
was to throw the whole power of
Greece into the hands of the Athenians;
but the steps by which he proposed to
attain this end, were so much disapproved,
that he was banished. Accused afterwards
of being concerned in the conspiracy
of Pausanias, the Lacedemonian
Admiral, for delivering Greece into the
hands of the Persians, he was obliged
to fly his country; and being pursued
from place to place, although innocent
of the charge preferred against him, he
was at last compelled to take refuge at
the Court of Persia.</p>

<p class='c005'>There he was most hospitably entertained
for several years; but in the succeeding
wars, the King requiring him
<a id='Page_216'></a>to lead an army against the Grecians,
he suffered the greatest distress in the
contest between gratitude and patriotism;
and neither of these virtues being
able to overcome the other, he ended
the conflict by putting a period to his
existence. On his being banished, Aristides
succeeded him in the charge of the revenues,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 470.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and Cimon in the
command of the forces. The glorious exploits
of this young hero almost eclipsed even
those of Miltiades, his father. He gained
several great victories over the Persians,
by sea and land, and beautified the city
with the spoils of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aristides dying, Pericles succeeded
him, and became the rival of Cimon,
who was banished on a suspicion
of favoring the Lacedemonians,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 455.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> but recalled five
years afterwards. He settled, for a time,
the differences between the rival cities,
<a id='Page_217'></a>and led them once more against the
common enemy. And having ended a
war of fifty-one years, by an honorable
peace with the Persians, he died on the
eve of returning to Athens. He was
succeeded by Thucydides, his brother-in-law,
but who was soon banished by
Pericles, who now exercised alone the
sovereign authority.</p>

<p class='c005'>This illustrious patriot was equally attentive
to the prosperity, and to the
beauty of the city. With one hand he
enriched her with the wealth of every
nation, with the other he adorned her
with the works of the most celebrated
masters. Phidias, the famous sculptor,
flourished in his administration, and it
is to him we are indebted for the magnificent
Temple of Minerva.</p>

<p class='c005'>But neither his refined genius, nor
his political abilities, could exempt his
country from the envy which prosperity
<a id='Page_218'></a>generally attracts. The splendour she
had attained, and the haughtiness it
occasioned, drew upon her the complaints
of many of the Powers of Greece,
and particularly of all those within the
Peloponnesus. Animated by Pericles,
Athens, although averse to hostile measures,
was resolved not to submit to
the attacks of the Lacedemonians, but,
conscious of her resources, determined
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 431.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>to support her
dignity; and thus, undaunted by
superior force, she sustained herself for
twenty-seven years, against the united
efforts of all her enemies, in the famous
Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pericles died at the close of the fourth
campaign; but the war was continued
until the end of the tenth, when a truce
was concluded, on terms very advantageous
to Athens. But the ambition
of Alcibiades, who now began to be
distinguished at Athens, soon brought on
<a id='Page_219'></a>a renewal of hostilities. He opposed
Nicias on every occasion, and, contrary
to the advice of that excellent General,
persuaded the Athenians to send a considerable
part of their forces into Sicily,
himself embarking on that expedition:
but, being soon recalled, he fled to Sparta,
where he joined the enemy, and became
the scourge of Attica. In the mean
while, Syracuse was reduced to great
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 413.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> straights; but,
a reinforcement arriving from Peloponnesus,
the Athenians were entirely defeated,
and Nicias, their General, most inhumanly
put to death.</p>

<p class='c005'>This blow dispirited the Athenians so
much, that Alcibiades, compassionating
their distress, returned to his duty. At
first he was surprisingly successful; but
the fleet suffering a defeat whilst he was
absent on an expedition, he was deprived
of the command, for having left it in
unworthy hands.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_220'></a>The Athenians had soon reason to repent
this act; for, notwithstanding their
fleet gained a considerable advantage
under Conon, it was afterwards attacked
by surprise in the Hellespont, and entirely
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 404.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> destroyed. Lysander,
who gained this celebrated victory, after
subduing all the maritime places in his
route, arrived at Athens, and obliged her
to surrender.</p>

<p class='c005'>The city now suffered all the horrors of
the most cruel tyranny and oppression: but
the Lacedemonians, exulting in their prosperity,
as the Athenians had done before,
raised up a confederacy against them, by
which, after ten years slavery, Athens
thoroughly recovered her liberty, and regained
her former consequence; and, although Thebes,
under Epaminondas, seemed for a time to rival
her, she maintained her superiority over the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 337.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> rest of Greece, until
Philip of Macedon, having defeated the Grecians
<a id='Page_221'></a>in the battle of Chæronea, obliged them to
nominate him Commander in Chief of their forces.</p>

<p class='c005'>Demosthenes had long observed the
steps by which this Monarch aimed at
the subjection of Greece, and endeavoured,
in his celebrated orations, to
rouse the spirit of his countrymen; but
he did not succeed until it was too
late.</p>

<p class='c005'>Philip left his authority to his son
Alexander, the Conqueror, during whose
absence in Persia, the Athenians attempted
to regain their liberties, but
were soon suppressed by his General Antipater.
On the death of Alexander, Athens
again revolted, and at first obtained
some considerable advantages;
but Antipater, being reinforced, put
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 322.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> an end to her
triumphs, and caused her principal
citizens to be put to death. Demosthenes
<a id='Page_222'></a>fled; but, being detected in his retreat,
he poisoned himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>From this time, Athens was almost
constantly kept in subjection by one or
other of the successors of Alexander, until
about two hundred years before Christ,
when, being attacked by Philip III. of
Macedon, the Athenians complained to
the Romans, who had lately concluded a
peace with the King, but now again declared
war against him; and being joined
by several of the Greek States, Philip
was soon overcome. The only use the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 196.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Romans made
of their conquest, was to shew their
magnanimity, by restoring liberty to
all the cities of Greece.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the war between Rome and Antiochus,
Greece was at first a principal
scene of action. In this, the Romans
were again successful, and confirmed
their former generosity: but, at last,
<a id='Page_223'></a>finding the different States constantly
at variance, and one or other of them
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 146.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> ever imploring
the assistance of Rome, they put an end
to their disputes, by forming them into
a Roman province. They had previously
defeated and taken Perseus, the last
King of Macedonia; after which, it only
remained to dispel the Achæan League,
which had been so famous under Philopœmen.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the war between Mithridates and
the Romans, the former got possession
of Athens; but, after a noble defence,
it was retaken the year following
by Sylla, who carried its library to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. A. C. 86.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Rome, with many
of its most valuable pieces of sculpture
and painting. Attica continued to share
the fate of the Romans, until their
great Empire was divided into the
Eastern and Western branches. Greece
<a id='Page_224'></a>then appertained to the former, and
fell with it into the hands of the Turks,
on the taking of Constantinople by
Mahomet II.--A. D. 1453.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Athens, February 3d, 1789.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>Athens still contains near ten
thousand inhabitants, and has lately
been enclosed by a wall, to defend it
from the irruptions of the Albanians,
who are ever ripe for a revolt, and have
several times plundered the town. The
neighbourhood abounds with olive trees,
and the French have established a small
factory for the culture of them. The
ancient citadel is always kept in a state
of defence; and, being situated on the
flat surface of an unassailable rock, it is
only to be subdued by famine, or a bombardment.
But what most renders it an
<a id='Page_226'></a>object of curiosity, is, its containing the
superb Temple of Minerva, the most
celebrated work of the illustrious Pericles.
But, alas! of this magnificent pile, only
enough is left to give us a faint idea
of its former grandeur, and to make us
lament the unhappy fate of so sublime
an edifice. The columns which supported
the south side, and part of the
front, are still standing, with some elegant
metopes, which represent the exploits
of the different heroes of Athens,
and the battle of the Amazons: but these
are every year falling down, from a
violent shock the remains of the temple
received, about a century ago, from the
Venetians, who, in bombarding the citadel,
blew up a powder magazine within
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>From these ruins of fallen greatness, it
is a pleasant relief to turn our eyes to
the Temple of Theseus, which, being
converted into a Greek church, is still
<a id='Page_227'></a>perfect. Here the sympathetic soul enjoys
the generous glow of admiration, in
contemplating a monument of gratitude
to a departed hero, and the satisfaction
of seeing, that the ravages of more than
two thousand years have not been able to
affect the work of a grateful people in
honor of a patriotic Prince: so may we
hope, that, to the last day, it will remain
a living proof of the generosity of the
one, and of the merit of the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Theseus was the great grandson of
Cecrops, and, like him, corrected the
wandering manner in which his people
lived, and formed them into civil
societies; whence he is justly called the
second founder of Athens.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the preceding narration, I took no
notice of the exploits of this Prince, because
they are stories we have been
accustomed to hear from our cradles,
and, although founded on truth, are
<a id='Page_228'></a>generally classed among those of the fabulous
kind. For the same reason, I
passed over the death of his successor,
Mnestheus, at the siege of Troy, as well
the expedition for the Golden Fleece,
and the other events in which Athens
was concerned previous to the invasion
of the Persians.</p>

<p class='c005'>The temple is an elegant edifice, supported
by a beautiful colonnade, on a
similar plan to the largest at Pestum. It
was erected in the administration of
Cimon, who, having discovered the
bones of Theseus in the island of Shyros,
where he was killed by a fall from a precipice,
restored them to his native city.
The metopes on the front, and part of
the sides, are ornamented with basso relievo,
representing the battle of the
Centaurs. These, you may recollect,
were nothing more than the cavalry of
Thessaly, where the men were so perfect
in the management of their horses, that,
<a id='Page_229'></a>when mounted, they were supposed to
be part of the same animal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The east gateway, which was also
erected to Theseus, remains tolerably
perfect. It was repaired by Adrian, who
added an inscription, importing that
Athens was now become his city; and,
indeed, by his liberality, he in some
measure made amends for the depredations
the Romans committed upon her
ornaments, and earned the title of one of
her founders. It was this Emperor who
raised that superb pile the Pantheon,
dedicated to all the Gods; which, by its
grandeur, elegance and beauty, justly
merited that exalted title. Out of an
hundred and twenty columns, each
eighteen feet in circumference, only nine
are standing. They are of the finest
marble, with very rich Corinthian capitals.
Those of Theseus and Minerva
are Doric.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_230'></a>The monument vulgarly called the
Lanthorn of Demosthenes, being inhabited
by a French Monk, and the
octagonal Temple of the Winds, by a
Turkish Dervise, are still entire. The
former is light and elegant; the latter
has nothing but its antiquity to recommend
it; for the figures which represent
the different winds, are so indifferently
executed, that, were not their names inscribed
below them, it would be impossible
to know their qualities.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some triumphal columns, and other
monuments, are still left in tolerable
preservation, besides a considerable part
of the Theatre of Bacchus, and many
other fragments and ruins, which I am
less particular in describing, because we
have taken exact plans of all of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The channel of the Ilyssus, whose
banks were formerly so famous, is dry,
even at this rainy season; and I have
<a id='Page_231'></a>several times walked in its bed, as well
as in the olive groves where Plato delivered
his lectures. I have also been as
far as the plains of Marathon, to pay
my oblations at the shrine of Miltiades--an
interesting scene to a Soldier, and of
which my military friends may expect
an exact description.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_232'></a>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE BATTLE OF MARATHON,<br /> <br />MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED<br /> <br />TO<br /> <br />THE RIGHT HONORABLE<br /> <br /><span class='large'>GENERAL ELIOTT,</span><br /> <br />LORD HEATHFIELD.<br /></h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>This celebrated field is about twelve
miles in circumference, and a day's
march from Athens. It is washed by
the sea on the east, and surrounded by
mountains on every other side, except
the south-east corner, where the flat is
continued a short space along the shore,
and afterwards terminated by hills. The
part where this slip joins the grand
plain, has a large morass in its center,
which extends pretty close to the hills on
one side, and near the water's edge on
the other.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_233'></a>There are two roads from the plains
to Athens; the one by the morass, the
other through the town of Marathon,
which lies at the foot of the hills, nearly
opposite the center of the plains.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miltiades' army, in point of numbers,
was not equal to one tenth of the Persians;
but he knew that by waiting for
them under the walls of Athens, he
should abandon the country to their ravages,
and submit to see them receive
their convoys, and gather provisions unmolested;
and possibly even subject himself
to a famine. He therefore determined,
at all events, to keep from between
the enemy and the capital, and
wait for an opportunity of attacking
them to advantage. And this Fortune
soon gave him. The Persians having
reached the plains of Marathon, accompanied
by their fleet, pursued the road
nearest the sea. Their van had already
ascended the heights, their main body
<a id='Page_234'></a>filled the flat beneath, and their rear
was passing the narrow space on the sides
of the morass. Historians tell us, that
Miltiades drew his whole strength into
his wings, and particularly his right,
leaving his center almost open. But as
they have not been sufficiently minute
in describing the scene of this memorable
action, I could not thoroughly perceive
the excellence of his disposition, until I
beheld the field of battle.</p>

<p class='c005'>The morass supplied the place of
troops in his center. The space on the
left was but narrow, consequently his
greatest exertions were required on his
right. This the General thoroughly understood,
and at the moment the Persians
were in the situation I have just
described, he rushed from the town of
Marathon, and by his admirable disposition,
brought his whole force to act on
the enemy's rear.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_235'></a>The Persians, encumbered and confined,
and scarce able to use their arms,
were instantly thrown into confusion,
and hewn down in immense numbers.
The main body faced about, and advanced
to the assistance of the rear. The
van, confident of victory from their
numbers, descended from the heights to
pursue their success. The whole crowded
together in the narrow passes, making
a general, confused attempt to break into
the plain: but the Athenians constantly
out-fronting them, and the immense
numbers of the enemy only serving to
incommode themselves, and to create
confusion, they were slain as fast as
they advanced. At length those in front,
unable to withstand the terrible carnage
that raged around them, attempted to
fly; but being prevented from retreating
by those behind them, who not having
seen the slaughter, still pushed forward,
they precipitately threw themselves into
the morass.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_236'></a>Victory now declared for the Athenians,
who, pursuing their advantage,
fell with such violence on the disordered
ranks of the enemy, that to escape their
fury, their nearest opponents were compelled
to turn, and in despair, forced
their way through their own friends. A
general rout immediately ensued, and
the exertions of the Athenians encreasing
with their success, they drove the
enemy headlong before them. Near
thirty thousand Persians fell by the
sword. Numbers perished in the morass,
and the rest, in confusion and dismay,
escaped to their ships.</p>

<p class='c005'>These, my Lord, are my ideas of the
principles on which Miltiades acted, and
what I have conceived to have been
the plan of the battle, from seeing the
plains on which it was fought. I am,
however, aware that one of the causes
to which I attribute the success of the
Greeks--their out-fronting the enemy--was
<a id='Page_237'></a>a less advantage in those days, than
it has become since the invention of
musketry and artillery. But although
the Grecians made their grand exertions
by close action, yet it is to be presumed,
from the hilly, irregular country in which
this army was generally to act, that it
was not without a considerable corps of
slingers and bowmen, who, in the disposition
I have given, might act to the
greatest advantage upon the enemy's
flank.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is needless to say that the Persians,
by forming <i>en potence</i> along the sides
of the morass, might have brought as
many men into action as the Greeks;
they were too much confused by the
sudden attack, bordering on a surprise,
to execute this manœuvre, and most
likely their troops with missive weapons
were not in this part of their
army.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_238'></a>The most plausible objection to my
plan is, that had the Persians, instead of
engaging and crowding themselves in
the situation Miltiades attacked them,
made a retreating fight, till they passed
the narrow flat, and secured the heights,
it was then in their power, had Miltiades
persisted in the attack, completely
to surround him, by making part of the
troop on the heights, in front, deploy
along the eminence, and then descend
in his rear, whilst the rest of the army,
now advantageously posted on the heights,
would probably have prevented his forcing
their front.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is, doubtless, what a good General
would have done. But when the
Generals are equal, how can men be
expected to beat ten times their number?
Miltiades was in one of those situations,
where inaction is as fatal as a defeat;
and it was his duty to seize every opportunity,
in which it was in Fortune's
<a id='Page_239'></a>power to favor his designs. He acted
on these principles, and was crowned
with the success his courage deserved.</p>

<p class='c005'>At first the Athenians thought no
praises they could bestow, equal to the
merit of Miltiades; but in my letter
from Paros, I mentioned the cruel persecution
he afterwards suffered. But
the death of this great man having disarmed
the malice of his enemies, they
soon became sensible of their shameful
ingratitude; and as some atonement to
the manes of their departed hero, they
erected a monument to his memory
on the plains where he gained his glory.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of this sacred tomb, only the base
remains. I picked up a chip of marble
that had fallen from it, and was instantly
impressed with the idea of having
this honored relick set, with a suitable
device, in some of the metal from the
Battering Ships, destroyed before Gibraltar,
<a id='Page_240'></a>and thus to commemorate and
unite the greatest victory of Greece,
with the most glorious achievement of
Britain.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Athens, February 5th, 1789.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>On our way to Marathon, we turned
a little out of the road to see a
mutilated statue of a Lion, which still
bears the signs of most excellent workmanship.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have already repeatedly viewed
every thing worthy notice in Athens;
but as the painter has not yet finished
his drawings, we shall remain here some
days longer, during which we mean to
make an excursion to the Islands of Salamis,
Ægina, &amp;c. But as they contain
nothing worthy description, I will close
<a id='Page_242'></a>this sketch of the history and antiquities
of this interesting city, with a short
account of the religion of its present
inhabitants. About one-fifth of them
are Turks, and the rest Greeks.</p>
<p class='c004'>GREEK RELIGION.</p>
<p class='c004'>St. Paul, you recollect, visited Athens,
and the other states of Greece, to preach
Christianity; and notwithstanding all the
anathemas the Pope has denounced against
the Greeks, there is, in fact, but
little difference between their religion,
and that of the Roman Catholics. They
equally make use of the sign of the cross;
worship images; pray to the saints;
have confessors; and believe in transubstantiation,
although they do not kneel
at the elevation of the Host. If they
deny the doctrine of purgatory, they
admit something very like it, in praying
for the souls of the dead. Their Bishops
and superior clergy are never permitted
<a id='Page_243'></a>to marry; but a simple priest is allowed
that indulgence once in his life, though
he can never take a second wife. They
acknowledge the Pope to be the chief
of the Patriarchs, but deny his having
the power of granting indulgences; and
this was his Holiness's first reason for accusing
them of schism.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is true, there is another grand point
in which they dissent both from the
Roman Catholics and the Protestants;
I mean the article of the Holy Ghost,
which they say can proceed from the
Father only. There are some less essential
differences, such as their using leavened
bread in the consecration of the
Sacrament, and mixing the bread and wine
together. And they also differ in the
ceremonies of baptism, marriage, and burial.
In the first they give three complete
immersions. The second is performed
by the priest's changing the ring from
the bride's to the bridegroom's finger,
<a id='Page_244'></a>saying a few words, and then from the
bridegroom's to the bride's. He repeats
this ceremony about thirty times, without
any alteration, and when he desists,
it is again as often performed by each
of the godfathers and godmothers. Their
funerals are like those of the savages--howling
and making hideous cries till
the corpse is interred, and then feasting
over the grave.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Patriarch of Constantinople is
the head of the Greek Church, and has
under him the Patriarchs of Jerusalem,
Damascus, and Alexandria. St. Polycarp
is their favorite Saint. He was
one of St. John's disciples, and suffered
martyrdom at Smyrna, of which he was
the first Archbishop.</p>
<p class='c004'>MAHOMETAN RELIGION.</p>
<p class='c004'>From the religion of the Greeks, I
naturally turn to that of the Turks. To
<a id='Page_245'></a>have a just idea of this, it is necessary
that we should divest ourselves of every
prejudice; and in arraigning the character
of a man whom death has prevented
from appearing in his own defence,
Justice ever requires, that if we
do not put the most favorable construction
on his actions, we should, at
least, treat them with impartiality.</p>

<p class='c005'>To speak candidly then, Mahomet
might be a religious and a moral man.
His father left him in rather penurious
circumstances, but profiting to the utmost
by the education his friends could
afford him, and always preserving a
most unexceptionable character, he rose
to be factor of a rich widow, whom he
afterwards married; and becoming, by
this connection, a person of some consequence
in his country, he felt it his
duty to devote himself to its welfare.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_246'></a>He saw, with the utmost concern, that
the Jews and the Christians were constantly
at variance, and that Idolatry was
daily gaining ground. To check the
progress of a practice so unworthy the
human mind, and so degrading to our
Divine Maker, appeared to him an object
worthy his whole attention. Filled
with this idea, it became the constant
subject of his thoughts, and after long
revolving it in his mind, he, at length,
conceived it impossible to attain his end
by any other method, but by that of
uniting the Jews and the Christians in
one religion. And this he knew could
only be effected by admitting part of the
tenets of both.</p>

<p class='c005'>For this purpose, he acknowledged
Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses,
whom the Jews regarded as their chief
Prophets, to whom he added our Blessed
Saviour; in commemoration of whose
<a id='Page_247'></a>mildness and beneficence, he called him
the Breath of God--the most flattering
appellation he could offer, confident with
the delicacy it was necessary to observe
towards the Jews. Nevertheless, a Christian
cannot sufficiently lament, that he
was obliged to make concessions to a
people execrated by God. But as his
only object was to restore the divine
worship to its original purity, he conceived
that the Almighty would not be
displeased at the means he was about
to adopt to attain so laudable an end.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first person to whom he communicated
his design, was her in whom,
as a good man, he was most interested,
I mean his wife. She readily embraced
his sentiments, and, in a short time,
many of their relations adopted their
opinions. Nevertheless, the Arabs in
general continued obstinate in their superstition
and idolatry; and as Mahomet as
yet only made use of the gentle methods
<a id='Page_248'></a>of persuasion, his proselytes increased so
slowly, that he had reason to despair of
success, unless he could make it be
believed that he received supernatural
assistance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus far his conduct is irreproachable,
since we may forgive his endeavouring
to compound the Jewish and Christian
religions, which in him, was at worst
but an error in judgment. But from
this moment, he began to lose sight of
the delicacy and patriotic disinterestedness
by which he was hitherto actuated,
and we must resign him to the lash of
the Christian and Jewish divines, both
of whom have agreed in stigmatizing
him by the epithet of "Impostor." Nevertheless
a philanthropic mind will
always be inclined to pity him, and to
lament that a man naturally religious,
with so noble an object in view, should
be drawn into measures unworthy the
piety of his primitive intentions.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_249'></a>He pretended, or perhaps his enthusiasm
made him believe, that the Angel
Gabriel had appeared to him; and, in
the name of God, charged him with
his mission. But still his progress was
not equal to his wishes; he therefore
made use of another imposture, and declared
that he had been carried up to
Heaven, and conversed with God. This,
and some miracles he was said to have
performed, gave him an unbounded sway
over the minds of the people. But the
persecution of the Government increasing
with his success, he was several times
obliged to fly from Mecca. Hitherto he
had preached nothing but peace; but
his fame having now spread, and gained
him many proselytes in the neighbouring
states, he found himself in a condition
to accomplish by force, what he had
in vain attempted by persuasion. Provoked
at the opposition he met with, he
gave out that God, irritated at the obstinacy
of his enemies, had ordered him
<a id='Page_250'></a>to take up arms against them. He therefore
raised an army, with which he beat
the Koreish, or head tribe of Mecca, in
the famous battle of Bedr, and gained
many other victories, each of which increasing
his fame and his followers, he
usurped the civil and military authority,
as well as the religious, and before he
died, had the satisfaction of seeing himself
acknowledged by many of the Eastern
nations.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Mahometans date their Hegira
from the period of their Prophet's
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A. D. 622.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> flight from Mecca
to Medina, during which such miracles,
they say, were performed in his favor,
that it was no longer possible to doubt
his being the Messenger of God.</p>

<p class='c005'>In addition to his being an Impostor,
and making use of violent measures, it
is farther objected against Mahomet, that
he makes his paradise consist in sensual
<a id='Page_251'></a>pleasures; but in this he conformed to
the dispositions of the people he held it
out to. He tells them that it is inhabited
by female angels, whose charms
surpass conception, and who, although
adorned by the most delicate modesty,
will yield to the embraces of the Faithful.
That they live in large pavilions of hollow
pearls, in the midst of refreshing fountains
and shady groves, abounding with
the most delicious fruits. Besides which,
the fleetest horses, elegantly caparisoned,
and every thing else they may desire,
will immediately spring up for them.</p>

<p class='c005'>His faith consists in belief in God,
and predestination; in his Angels, his
Scriptures, and his Prophets; in the
Resurrection and final Judgment. On
that awful day the principal questions
asked the Mahometans will be, How
they spent their time? How they acquired
and used their wealth? What use
<a id='Page_252'></a>they made of their knowledge? and how
they exercised their bodies?</p>

<p class='c005'>Infidels and hypocrites will be damned
without redemption; but the good
and bad actions of the Mahometans will
be balanced against each other, and the
punishments of the guilty will be in proportion
to their sins; the slightest of
which will be nine hundred years confinement
in a hell, so very hot as to
make the brain boil through the skull;
and the heaviest nine thousand in a place
where the heat is seven times more horrible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oppressors, and such as have been
guilty of malice or injustice, will be
obliged to suffer in the next world for
the sins of those whom they injured in
this. An idea that cannot be too much
admired.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_253'></a>Another striking instance of the humanity
of Mahomet's disposition, is the
great encomiums he conferred upon
Charity. He tells his followers that
nothing will be more acceptable to God
than alms; and to shew our gratitude to
him for those we are constantly receiving
at his hands, he orders that they shall
pray at least five times a day; and that
there may be no excuse for neglecting this
duty, the muezzins are obliged to ascend
the steeples at stated times, and there
apprise the people that "it is time to
pray."</p>

<p class='c005'>In this we see both gratitude and wisdom;
and to do ample justice to Mahomet,
it only remains to examine how
far his religion tended to promote the
happiness and prosperity of his brethren.
To do this, we must keep their country
in view. It will then readily occur to
us, that the Arabians living in a state of
<a id='Page_254'></a>warfare, population must necessarily decrease,
and the number of women considerably
exceed that of the men. What
remedy could he apply to this evil, but
a plurality of wives? Or how put a
stop to drunkenness, but by prohibiting
wine? The climate of Arabia is hot;
heat produces wantonness, wantonness
leads to prostitution, and prostitution
creates sin, disease, and depopulation.
These are crying evils, and the only
method to prevent them was, by forbidding
every intercourse between the
two sexes, man and wife only excepted.
For she must be an abandoned woman
indeed, who will make the first advances
to impure love, and these to
a man to whom she had never before
spoken.</p>

<p class='c005'>But as a farther encouragement to population,
and that the female captives
taken in war might be of service to
<a id='Page_255'></a>the state, he tolerates masters lying
with their slaves, who, on their part,
are to preserve all the modesty and
discretion of a wife, and in return,
are always to be treated with tenderness.</p>

<p class='c005'>That Mahomet allowed these indulgences,
more through policy than inclination,
is evident, since even his bitterest
enemies have never accused him of
bigamy, or of impure love, before the
death of his first wife. If he afterwards
became abandoned, it is no wonder, for
he had then cast off his pious principles;
and every wise person knows, whatever
pretenders to philosophy may say,
that a man, when he abandons religion,
generally abandons morality
also.</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon the whole, I believe, this is by
much the most favorable account ever
<a id='Page_256'></a>written of Mahomet by a Christian; yet,
if we analyze the writings of our own
theologists, and set aside their abusive
epithets, we shall find that I have said
nothing more than they themselves have
admitted; because, not understanding
the Turkish language, I have trusted to
them for matters of fact, although, in
justice to a dead man, I could not ascribe
to ambition and selfishness, what might
originally proceed from virtue, however
different a turn it might afterwards
take.</p>

<p class='c005'>To close this essay with the candour
with which I have conducted it, we must
allow, that as a patriot and a politician,
Mahomet merits a great share of our commendation.
But how unworthy a divine
mission will his latter conduct appear,
when compared with that of our
Saviour. Neither persecution nor torture,
could provoke the Blessed Jesus to
<a id='Page_257'></a>a deviation from his Heavenly Mildness;
but constantly adhering to the will of
our Father, he lived, and he died for the
good of mankind.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Leghorn, March 10th, 1788.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>On the 9th of February we sailed
from the Pyræus, but the next morning
a violent gale rising up against us,
we were obliged to take shelter in our old
port at Idra. During the night the wind
changed, and at day-break on the 11th
we again got under way, and sailing
along the coast of Mycene and Argos,
the kingdoms of Agamemnon and Menelaus,
reached Cape Angelo at sunset;
and standing to the westward, we passed
between Servi and the island of Venus;
and thus, for the present, took leave of
the Archipelago. We saw no remains of
<a id='Page_259'></a>antiquity on that part of Peloponnesus
which we have coasted.</p>

<p class='c005'>At day-break on the 14th, we were
in sight of Mount Ætna, but the wind
not permitting us to fetch Messina, we
stood towards Syracuse, and in the
evening tacked near the little island
of Ortygia, which furnished the poets,
with the fable of Alpheus and Arethusa.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next day was almost a calm, but
at sunset a light breeze springing up in
our favor, we entered the straits of
Scylla and Charybdis, and anchored at
Messina on the 16th. Here we intended
to have performed our quarantine,
but as it has been the custom at this place
ever since the dreadful plague in 1743,
not to receive vessels from any port
actually infected; and a lying report being
raised, that the plague was then raging
in the environs of Smyrna, the Health
<a id='Page_260'></a>Office refused to admit us, notwithstanding
or bringing a clean bill of health.
We therefore put to sea the following
evening, and had scarce passed Charybdis,
and got out of the straits, before
we were attacked by a violent storm.
We were now on a lee-shore, and the
darkness of the night made our situation
still more unpleasant. But at the moment
we were most apprehensive, the
wind favored us several points. The
next morning the gale abated, and in
the evening the wind became quite fair;
there was, however, so little of it, that
we were all this and the next day in
sight of the burning island of Strombolo.
In the night of the 19th, the
breeze freshened, and carrying us 7,
8, 9, 10, and 11 knots an hour, we
saw Corsica soon after day-light on the
21st, and at five the same afternoon anchored
in Leghorn roads. Lord Hervey,
who has succeeded Sir Horace
Mann, as Ambassador at Florence, happening
<a id='Page_261'></a>to be at Leghorn, interested
himself in our favor; in consequence
of which our quarantine was only fifteen
days, and we got prattick the day before
yesterday.</p>

<p class='c005'>The town is well fortified both by
sea and land, and, on account of its
advantageous situation for trade, and
its being a free port, it is filled with
merchants of every class and persuasion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Corsica being in sight of Leghorn, it
forms one of the passes that intercept
the trade of the Mediterranean, and
is consequently an excellent station for
a squadron in time of war. The road,
indeed, is open, and in winter dangerous;
but this evil is, in some measure,
remedied by two capacious moles,
deep enough for trading vessels and
small frigates. And by means of a
<a id='Page_262'></a>canal which communicates with the
Arno, it has water carriage even beyond
Florence. I shall set out for that
celebrated capital, as soon as I am a little
collected after the voyage.</p>

</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Florence, March 23d, 1788.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>We left Leghorn on the 18th, and,
two hours after, arrived at Pisa.
We remained there the rest of the day,
and had just time to take a cursory view
of the wonderful Leaning Tower, the
celebrated Brazen Gates of the Cathedral,
the Dome, the College, and the Chapel
of the Knights of St. Stephen, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Early next morning, we resumed our
journey, and, at four in the afternoon,
arrived at this elegant city.</p>

<p class='c005'>From Leghorn to Florence is sixty-three
miles, or, in the Italian style, eight
<a id='Page_264'></a>posts, for each of which, with a pair of
horses, you pay four shillings, and the
driver is entitled to a fifth, which custom
has increased to eighteen pence. The
Italian miles being near a fourth shorter
than the English, you generally go a post
in an hour and a few minutes; but this
depends very much upon what you give
the postilions, who always take care to
enquire from those they relieve. The
road is good and level, and remarkably
pleasant, the whole of it being in the
populous and fertile vale of Arno, and
almost constantly close to the river.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the barbarous ages, after the subversion
of the Roman empire, Tuscany
underwent many revolutions, and remained
in a state of subjection till the
time of the Guelphs and Gibbelines,
when the feuds of those factions, and
the contests between the Pope and the
Emperor, enabled the Tuscans to shake
off the yoke. They were again subdued
<a id='Page_265'></a>by Charles V. who, having married
his natural daughter to Alexander of
Medicis, he gave him the Dukedom of
Tuscany: but Alexander, being a tyrant,
was soon assassinated, and Cosmo, son of
John of Medicis set up in his place, and
formally crowned Grand Duke of Tuscany
by Pope Pius V.--A. D. 1570.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is to this immortal Prince that we
are indebted for the revival of the fine
arts, and for the foundation of the Gallery
of Florence, which each of his descendants
increased and improved. The
dukedom remained in their line for the
space of near two centuries, when the
Medicis being extinct by Duke Gaston
dying without issue, it revolved to the
Emperor, and is now governed by his
brother.</p>

<p class='c005'>The arts and sciences suffered no loss
from this change. Peter Leopold is their
most distinguished patron; and the Gallery
<a id='Page_266'></a>is as much indebted to him as to the
most elegant of his predecessors.</p>

<p class='c005'>Formerly, people of humble fortunes
were secluded from the view of these
treasures, by the extortion of the attendants;
but their salaries have been
lately increased, and they are prohibited
from accepting presents, on pain of
losing their places. The poorest peasant
has now a right to amuse himself at his
leisure in every part of the Gallery, and
admittance is refused to nobody but
servants. It affords matter of surprise to
an Englishman, that valets de chambres,
and footmen, who have so much influence
every where else, are here excluded
from places that are open to
the lowest of every other tribe.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have not troubled myself about the
private character of Peter Leopold; but
the face of his country, the industry and
morality of his subjects, and the pleasing
<a id='Page_267'></a>signs of an happy and increasing population,
prove him a great and a good
Prince. The morals of his people are
one of his principal objects, in which he
has so happily succeeded, that, in the
general free mart of Leghorn, where
formerly the trade of a harlot was as
much permitted and in as high repute as
any other, the houses of ill fame are
reduced to a very small number; and, in
a short time, prostitution will be as completely
rooted out there as it already is
out of every other part of Tuscany.</p>

<p class='c005'>By a law, as uncommon as it is just, a
breach of modesty is as severely punished
in the male as in the female sex; and
a seducer, be his rank what it will, is
obliged to marry the object he has polluted.
None of either sex are permitted
to shut themselves up in convents; and
marriage is highly encouraged. Such,
indeed, is this Prince's success in promoting
morality, and preventing vice
<a id='Page_268'></a>among his people, that, different from
most capitals, the women are innocent
and healthy, as well as beautiful; and
assassinations and robberies are here no
longer heard of.</p>

<p class='c005'>What a satisfaction will the philanthrope
enjoy, when he finds that this
public happiness and virtue has been
produced by the most laudable means.
Peter Leopold thinks the lives of his
subjects too valuable to sacrifice even
one to the gallows or the scaffold; but
if a citizen is guilty of any transgression,
he atones for his crime by labouring
on the public works, for the general
good, with a label on his back, expressing
his crime and his punishment.</p>

<p class='c005'>This being the Holy Week, the Gallery
will not be open for some days,
which is no great disappointment, since
the fine taste of the Medicis was not
confined to their palaces only. The
<a id='Page_269'></a>town is ornamented with many celebrated
pieces of sculpture; the principal
of which are, the group of Hercules
rescuing Dejanira from the Centaur, by
Michael Angelo; and the Rape of the
Sabines, by John Bologna; a superb
fountain, with Neptune in the center,
drawn by four horses, surrounded by as
many persons, each attended by two
fawns or satyrs; a noble equestrian of
Cosmo, and many other excellent statues
and columns, and a triumphal arch,
erected in honour of the reigning family.
I should be guilty of great injustice to
Peter Tacca, if I passed over his famous
boar in the market-place. He forms a
kind of fountain on the ground, slabbering
out water in so natural a manner,
that, at first, I actually took him for a
hog, too lazy to remove from the wet.</p>

<p class='c005'>The inside of the churches are neat
and elegant, white and gold, with scarlet
and orange curtains. St. Croix contains
<a id='Page_270'></a>the tombs of M. Angelo, of Machiavel,
and many other great men. Among a
variety of paintings, two in the dome
of St. John are rather singular, <i>Lex
Scripta</i> and <i>Lex Naturæ</i>. The former
has a forbidding look, and is muffled
up like a priestess. The other is in all
the gaiety of youth, with an inviting
person almost entirely displayed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The soft gliding Arno divides the
town; but the communication is preferred
by three stone bridges. The terraces
along its banks are broad and well
paved; and were it possible to tire where
a variety of such objects as those I have
mentioned are ever to be found, one has
only to retire to the Botanical Gardens,
or to those of the Bobile. In the former
we find every plant of the medical
world. In the latter we may fancy ourselves
in England. They are laid out
much in the manner of our pleasure
grounds, with open gravel walks, and
<a id='Page_271'></a>others shaded by the twining branches
of the shrubs on each side; with an
aviary, a green-house, seats, and summer
houses. But partaking also of the Italian,
it is interspersed with statues, terraces,
and fountains full of gold and
silver fish.</p>

<p class='c005'>How can we sufficiently express our
gratitude to those Princes who have
furnished us with so many objects of
innocent and laudable delight.</p>

<p class='c005'>The elegant taste of the Tuscan Sovereigns,
has been adopted by most of
their Nobility, whose palaces may be
considered as so many branches of the
royal gallery. I have as yet only had
time to visit those of Gerrini and Ricardi.</p>

<p class='c005'>Biliberti's famous Clorinda would alone
be sufficient to immortalize the former.
She is asleep, relieved from the weight
<a id='Page_272'></a>of her armour, with nothing to conceal
any part of her exquisite beauty, but
one of the ribbons of her corselet, which
the air has most happily directed to
shelter her modesty; but which one is
almost afraid will wave from her waist.
In this unguarded moment, Tancred at
once discovers her sex and her beauty;
but notwithstanding her defenceless situation,
notwithstanding her irresistible
charms, and her being a chief of the
enemy, there is something so invincibly
sweet, so chaste, and so inchanting in
her countenance, that the hero stands
transfixed with love and veneration, and
dares not approach her. It is impossible
not to enter into all the delicacy and
sensibility of his feelings, and after the
first glance, I confess to you, that,
like him, I dared not suffer my eyes
to wander below her neck, lest hers
should open and avenge my profanation.
An adverse look from such an
<a id='Page_273'></a>angel, would be more insupportable than
the most tormenting death.</p>

<p class='c005'>After so heavenly an object, one is
particularly struck with Salvator Rosa's
Prometheus, in the same collection. He
is stretched upon his back, with his
hands and feet chained down, and the
vulture preying on his liver. His excruciating
torments are so forcibly expressed,
that they fill one with horror. I
therefore turned away, and hurried by
Dido and Æneas, by Battoni; and the
Martyrdom of St. Andrew, by Carlo
Dolce, and several other admirable paintings,
to gaze once more on the divine
Clorinda.</p>

<p class='c005'>The best pieces in the Palace Ricardi,
are, the four Evangelists, by Carlo
Dolce; St. John is incomparable; a
Roman Charity, and six figures, representing
basso relievo.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_274'></a>The house in which Michael Angelo
lived, is still preserved, and his history
and principal works represented in a collection
of paintings, with which the
walls were hung by his scholars. It also
contains some few pieces of his own,
most of them unfinished.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Florence, March 26th, 1789.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>When I inform you, that the Catalogue
alone of the Gallery of
Florence, fills a large volume, what an
unconscionable request will my dear
friend appear to have made, in demanding
a regular description of this superb
and invaluable collection.</p>

<p class='c005'>From so young an Amateur as I am,
such an attempt, methinks, would be the
height of presumption--I had almost
said, of profanation. But, to convince
you how much I would undertake to
oblige you, suffice it to say, that the part
<a id='Page_276'></a>properly called the Gallery, consists of
two sides of a parallelogram of considerable
length, joined together by a
third, much shorter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Round the cornice, the portraits of
every great character, of whatever nation
he belonged to, from Artaxerxes Memnon,
King of Persia, to Dr. Anthony
Cocchi, who died at Florence in 1758,
are ranged according to their country.
Among the English, I observed Wolsey,
Cranmer, Cromwell, and Monk.</p>

<p class='c005'>The wall between the cornice and the
moulding, is lined with about an hundred
and thirty paintings, by the most
celebrated masters: all are admirable;
but that which particularly strikes me, is
the Mary Magdalen from the Tuscan
school. Her hands are joined together
with an expression which evinces the
anguish of her soul, and the sincerity of
her repentance. A skull is on the table
before her. Remorse and Despair, in
<a id='Page_277'></a>their most aggravated forms, are preying
upon her; and yet her beauty is in all
its captivating charms. Her face surpasses
every conception; and the vest,
which has fallen from her shoulders,
displays a neck which even an Anchorite
would for ever hang upon. She herself,
with all the earnestness of her supplication,
seems scarce to dare hope to be
forgiven.--But, were there a doubt of it,
sweet Penitent! I should die distracted.</p>

<p class='c005'>John de St. John's Bridal Night, is
another excellent painting. He has
given the Bride all the fondness and
beauty of a Venus, but has made her
more than the Goddess, by shewing that
the height of conjugal love, could not
remove her natural modesty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her handmaids are leading her into
her bed-chamber; but, when she discovers
her husband ready to receive her,
modesty overcomes her, and prevents
<a id='Page_278'></a>her advancing. The longing Bridegroom
invites her with the most ardent affection,
and, with a smile of tenderness,
seems amused with her coyness. She returns
his smile, but with a kind of denial;
and yet seems wishing to comply,
but cannot persuade herself to approach
him. Her Friends are encouraging her,
and the old Nurse is growing angry at
the delay. But I am presuming to be
particular. I therefore pass over the rest
of the paintings, and come to the statues
and busts, which are ranged on bases, at
regular distances, along the walls.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the east end, there is a Horse,
whose head and body excel any thing
of the kind I ever beheld; but the legs
are modern, and do not seem to belong
to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Were only the head and neck of Leda
exposed, all mankind would allow her to
be the finest piece of sculpture ever produced:
<a id='Page_279'></a>but, whilst we give the Sculptor
every credit for his execution, we are
provoked at finding him guilty of many
inconsistencies.</p>

<p class='c005'>I should not have said so much of
this statue, but that you, like myself,
might have been deceived by the good
nature of those well-meaning, but shallow
writers, who, struck with its first
appearance, did not examine farther.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ganymede is, indeed, an admirable
statue; and his Eagle is much superior
to Leda's Swan.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pomona seems really walking, and
with a lightness equal to the ease of
her person.</p>

<p class='c005'>As there is no superlative difficulty
in forming a figure where no passion
is particularly expressed, I will not
dwell on Minerva, Bacchus, Apollo,
<a id='Page_280'></a>Narcissus, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. notwithstanding
the pleasure I enjoy in admiring them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The busts contain the heads of all the
Roman Emperors, and of some of their
wives. The whole is closed by a famous
wild boar, and the group of Laocoon.</p>

<p class='c005'>Parallel to each of the two long sides
of the Gallery, there is a set of apartments,
included in what is commonly
called the Gallery of Florence.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first on the east side, contains a
most admirable Ganymede, a country
God, and a few more beautiful statues
and basso relievos. The principal subjects
of the latter, are, the Rape of
Europa, and Mark Anthony's Oration
on opening Cæsar's Will.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next, called the Cabinet of Coins
and Medals, contains, as well as those
articles and some few busts, two basso-relievo
<a id='Page_281'></a>figures of Mars and Venus, in
paste exactly like porphyry; and also
seven pictures, three of which are Mosaic:
those of St. Peter and St. Paul are
reckoned remarkably fine.</p>

<p class='c005'>The third is called the Cabinet of
Love, from a little Cupid sleeping on a
table, universally allowed to be a masterpiece
of sculpture. It also contains a
few busts, and the walls are ornamented
with twenty-seven paintings; among
which is a Venus, by Titian, universally
admired: but it has been observed, that
she labours under a disadvantage, in
being so near the incomparable one in
the Tribuna.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fourth is filled with small statues,
busts and pictures.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the room called La Tribuna is the
boast of the whole Gallery. It contains
the Venus of Medicis, the Wrestlers, the
<a id='Page_282'></a>Listener, and the Fawn, which surpass
what I thought it possible for marble to
express. Nobody that has heard of
Florence, but must have read a particular
description of these admirable statues:
but, in obedience to your desire, I have
set down the following measurements of
the Venus of Medicis, taken by myself:</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_283'></a>The paintings in the Tribuna are equal
to the statues. The most famous is
Titian's celebrated Venus, which justly
merits the high encomiums universally
conferred upon her. She is lying on a
bed, with all her beauties displayed.
The painter, with great judgment, has
given her a passive countenance, and introduced
a softness in her air, full of languishing
desire, but free from lascivious
wantonness. One might compare her to
a most beautiful married woman, deprived
for the first time of the presence
of a beloved husband. In a word, nothing
can be more perfect, or more delightful.</p>

<p class='c005'>St. Catherine also by Titian, is another
excellent painting, and the Virgin Mary,
with the infant Jesus on her knees, like
all Carlo Dolce's pictures, is divine and
beautiful.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_284'></a>Had I found the visitation of St.
Elizabeth and St. John, fondling the
little Jesus on the Virgin's lap, and several
others, in any place but where
there is so much to admire, I should
have thought each of them worthy a particular
description.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next four chambers contain the
Venus Anadyomene, and a few more statues
in marble; together with a variety of
beautiful vases, plates, cups, and tables,
richly inlaid with lapis lazuli and other
rich stone; near four hundred paintings
in the Flemish manner; a collection of
original designs, or rough sketches, of
the best masters, and another of prints;
but these are very inferior to those of the
moderns, and are only meant to show
the progress of the art.</p>

<p class='c005'>The cabinet of jewels and precious
stones, cameos, intaglios, &amp;c. closes the
Eastern range.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_285'></a>It is with great pain that I find myself
inadequate to an entertaining description
of these invaluable treasures. The picture
of St. Lawrence conducted to the tyrant;
Hercules after he had killed the Giants,
by Alexander Allori; Helena Forman, by
Paul Rubens; the pearl fishery, in lapis
lazuli, by Anthony Tempesta; the Rape
of Dejanira, by Giordano; the copy of
Correggio's Mary Magdalen, and many
others I could gaze upon for ever. But
the objects of admiration I here meet
with, are too numerous to permit me to
send you even a list of them.--I have
already transgressed the bounds I had
proposed to myself; but having gone
thus far, I will proceed in the same
style through the apartments on the west
side.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first then is called the Cabinet
of Medals, and contains a well arranged
collection, amounting to the astonishing
number of upwards of fourteen thousand.
<a id='Page_286'></a>Many false antiques have been admitted,
that amateurs may have an opportunity
of studying the difference between them
and real ones. Over the seven bureaux,
in which the medals are preserved, the
Labours of Hercules are represented in
as many silver groupes, copied from
John Bologna.</p>

<p class='c005'>But these are not the only masterpieces
contained in this chamber. Over
the chimney there is a hand in relief,
by Michael Angelo, equal to his most
celebrated work; and the walls are ornamented
by thirty-six pictures, painted
at Florence.</p>

<p class='c005'>The second and third rooms contain
the portraits of several hundred painters,
most of them drawn by themselves.
What a satisfaction to contemplate the
characters of those celebrated masters,
whose works have afforded us the highest
gratification. But as admittance has
<a id='Page_287'></a>never been refused to the most humble
candidate for fame, who may choose to
send his portrait, many have gained a
place here, who will soon be forgotten
every where else. In point of execution,
my friend the Princess Belmonté, I am
afraid, is among this number; but as a
patroness of the arts and sciences, she
is justly entitled to a place in the gallery
of Florence; and, as long as St. Cecilia
is held in veneration, the tuneful, the
generous Belmonté will ever be remembered.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fourth is filled with the heads of
illustrious persons, and a variety of inscriptions.
On one of which, Seraspandes
and Rhodaspes, the sons of
Phraates, are mentioned; and it is particularly
valued because Justin, the only
Roman historian who takes notice of
these Princes being at Rome, omitted
their names.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_288'></a>The fifth contains a beautiful statue
of an hermaphrodite, which gives name
to the chamber; an Adonis, by Michael
Angelo; Venus Victrix; Venus
Celeste, and a Bacchus. All excellent
statues; and near fifty valuable paintings.</p>

<p class='c005'>The present Grand Duke fitted up
the sixth hall for the reception of Niobe,
and her fourteen children, with a taste
and magnificence worthy these admirable
statues.</p>

<p class='c005'>The collection of old paintings in the
next room is also the work of the reigning
Prince. They are accompanied by
several busts and statues.</p>

<p class='c005'>The eighth contains copies in bronze,
not only of the Venus of Medicis, and
the most admired pieces in the preceding
apartments, but of every other celebrated
statue, of which the Dukes of Florence
<a id='Page_289'></a>have not been able to procure the original.
Among these are the <i>Quirinal</i>
group of horses; the <i>Capitol</i> Gladiator;
the <i>Vatican</i> Apollo, and Meleagre; the
little <i>Spanish</i> fawn; the <i>Farnese</i> Hercules,
Bull, and Flora, and many others,
which the severest critics have allowed to
be equal to the originals.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it is not copies only which here
ravish the sight. John Bologna's incomparable
Mercury soon arrests the eye.
He is absolutely flying, and in so easy,
and so natural an attitude, that it is
some moments before one perceives
that he is supported by the breath of
Zephyr, on which he is rising into the
air.</p>

<p class='c005'>From this we pass into the cabinet
of bronze antiques, where a variety of
miniature Gods and Goddesses, animals,
and monsters; altars, tripods, and lamps;
<a id='Page_290'></a>helmets, rings, and bracelets, &amp;c. &amp;c.
are preserved in fourteen cases.</p>

<p class='c005'>We now close the Gallery with the
Tuscan Museum, whose chief contents
are the instruments used by the ancients
in their funeral ceremonies, with a variety
of urns, in which the burnt bones
of the dead were deposited.</p>

<p class='c005'>There let them rest in peace, and if
sleep has not already overpowered you,
indulge it now--I shall not be offended
with you. I am aware, that however
refined and extatic the satisfaction, the
objects I have mentioned afford to the
senses, this pleasure is not to be communicated
in a description by so humble
a Dilettante as your poor friend.
I have, therefore, nearly confined myself
to an abridgment of the catalogue,
which, as I before apprised you, fills
a large volume. And since a long list,
<a id='Page_291'></a>even of painters, and sculptors, statues,
and paintings, must ever be dry and
tautological, what can we expect from
its epitome? But to me, I confess, it has
afforded the greatest satisfaction; that
of proving that to please you, I willingly
risk exposing myself.</p>

</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Naples, April 23, 1788.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>We left Florence on the 27th of
March, and, on the 6th instant,
sailed from Leghorn.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little island of Elba lying in our
course towards Naples, we meant to stop
there, for a few hours, to examine the
harbour, which, it is said, is a very convenient
one for vessels watching an
enemy in Leghorn Roads; but, having
no wind till three o'clock in the afternoon,
we did not reach it till dusk. We
were now going nine knots an hour.
Nothing could be seen till the morning;
<a id='Page_293'></a>and, as we did not think it right to lose
a night's run with so favourable a wind,
we were deprived of the satisfaction of
informing ourselves with regard to the
harbour, and of gratifying our curiosity,
by seeing the natural state of the curious
stones found in this island.</p>

<p class='c005'>The wind continuing fair, we passed
Mount Cercelle, and the coast of Rome,
on the 7th; at day-light on the 8th,
were in sight of Ischia and Capria; but,
our fair wind dying away, we did not
get to an anchor in the bay of Naples
till the afternoon of the next day.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mount Vesuvius is in a very different
state from that in which we left it.
There have been several eruptions. The
sides of the crater or cone have fallen in,
and the lava has given itself vent, by
forcing the side of the mountain. It
is now running; and, as this is a phenomenon
I had not an opportunity of
<a id='Page_294'></a>seeing when I was here last autumn,
I made it my first object on my
return.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the violence of the eruption is
over; and it has now more of the curious
and beautiful, than of the awful
and sublime. The side of the mountain
has closed, and the lava issues from it,
without its source being seen, in a stream
of liquid fire, at present not more than
four feet wide. It moves at a slow rate,
and, although so much a fluid as to be
capable of this motion, yet it has such a
degree of solidity, that stones of some
pounds weight, thrown with force, did
not penetrate its surface. No flame was
emitted by the lava, except when we
threw slicks, paper, or other combustible
matter upon it, which immediately took
fire, and blazed. Water had no effect,
but that of blackening, for a moment,
the part it fell upon.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_295'></a>After having sufficiently admired this
beautiful phenomenon, we scrambled up
the cone, and went into the inside of
the old crater, which I find is already
assuming its former state; the working
of the fire in the bowels of the earth,
having overcome the weight above it,
and formed a chasm in its former direction,
to the very summit of the
mountain.</p>

<p class='c005'>This aperture is continually widening,
and will soon again become a monstrous
fiery gulph. I heard several explosions
below, which were accompanied
by flashes of fire, which, darting
from side to side, in the direction of
the chasm, came up like so many immense
flashes of forked lightning.</p>

<p class='c005'>We began the ascent before sun-set;
and our attention was so well engaged,
that it was near day-light before we
returned to Naples.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_296'></a>The Princess Belmonté has renewed
her civilities; and the Nobile have
sent us tickets for their musical Conversazione.</p>

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Palermo, May 2d, 1788.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>After a pleasant passage of scarce
forty hours, at day-break on the
26th ult. we found ourselves in sight of
Palermo. Nothing can be more picturesque
than this bay. It forms a large
amphitheatre, with the Capital of Sicily
in the center, surrounded, for some
miles, by a most beautiful country, interspersed
with villas, and inclosed by
romantic rocks and mountains. A calm,
which lasted several hours, gave us an
opportunity of admiring this beautiful
scene at our leisure; and in the afternoon
we anchored in the mole.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_298'></a>The town was formerly surrounded
by a strong wall, but the fortifications
are now entirely neglected, except towards
the sea, where there are still a few
weak works.</p>

<p class='c005'>Prince Caramanico, the Viceroy, was
lately Ambassador at London. We paid
our respects to him the morning after
our arrival, and he gave us a state dinner
the next day. But we have seen nothing
of him since.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our stay here is rendered remarkable
by the sudden death of Prince Palagonia.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst other men endeavoured to reach
the Temple of Fame, by making art
equal nature in her most captivating
forms, this Prince struck out a new road,
by producing such monsters as nature,
however perverted, could never have
brought forth. With him, whoever designed
<a id='Page_299'></a>the most ridiculous and unnatural
object, became the greatest artist. He
had a number of sculptors and stone-cutters
constantly employed for upwards
of thirty years, and their productions
amount to near a thousand pieces. But
notwithstanding the great encouragement
he gave, and the ample field he held
out, very few of his statues display
either genius, execution, or invention.
Some of them, indeed, are as extravagant
as he could wish, but even these are extravagant
without humour, from the
total want of connection in the members.
We sometimes laugh at a body
a little deformed, because the parts that
compose it may be set in a ridiculous
point of view; but where they are totally
heterogeneous, and unconnected,
we may be surprised, but cannot be
pleased. The principal pieces are birds
and beasts with human heads, and men
with the heads of beasts.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_300'></a>Whilst we were beholding this grotesque
collection with a smile, half of
pity, and half of contempt, I was struck
by an antique bust of Cleopatra, by
much the most beautiful I ever saw;
but its owner set so little value upon it,
that it is stuck against the outside of
his house, with another of M. Anthony,
nearly as good.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dead at Palermo are never buried;
but their bodies are carried to the
Capuchin Convent, where, after the
funeral service is performed, they are
dried in a stove, heated by a composition
of lime, which makes the skin adhere
to the bones. They are then placed
erect in niches, and fastened to the wall
by the back or neck. A piece of coarse
drab is thrown over the shoulders, and
round the waist; and their hands are
tied together, holding a piece of paper
with their epitaph, which is simply
their names, age, and when they died.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_301'></a>We of course visited this famous repository,
and it is natural to suppose,
that so many corpses would impress one
with reverence and awe. It was near
dusk when we arrived at the Convent.
We passed the chapel where one
of the order had just finished saying
vespers, by the gloomy glimmering of
a dying lamp. We were then conducted
through a garden, where the
yew, the cypress, and the barren orange
obscured the remaining light, and where
melancholy silence is only disturbed by
the hollow murmuring of a feeble waterfall.
All these circumstances tuned our
minds for the dismal scene we were going
to behold, but we had still to descend
a flight of steps impervious to the sun.
And these, at last, conveyed us to the
dreary mansion of the dead.</p>

<p class='c005'>But (will you believe me?) notwithstanding
the chilling scene we had gone
through; notwithstanding our being in
<a id='Page_302'></a>the midst of more than a thousand lifeless
bodies, neither our respect for the
dead, or for the holy fathers who conducted
us, could prevent our smiling.
For the physiognomies of the deceased
are so ludicrously mutilated, and their
muscles so contracted and distorted in
the drying, that no French mimick could
equal their grimaces. Most of the corpses
have lost the lower part of the nose--their
necks are generally a little twisted--their
mouths drawn awry in one direction--their
noses in another--their
eyes sunk and pointed different ways--one
ear perhaps turned up--the other
drawn down. The friars soon observed
the mirth these unexpected visages occasioned,
and one of them as a kind of
<i>memento</i>, pointed out to me a Captain
of Cavalry, who had just been cut off
in the pride of his youth. But three
months ago he was the minion of a
King--the favorite of a Princess--Alas!
how changed! Even on earth there is
<a id='Page_303'></a>no distinction between him and the
meanest beggar. This in a moment returned
me to myself, and I felt, with
full force, the folly of human vanity.
I turned to the holy father, who gave
me this lesson. His eyes were fixed on
what was once a Captain of horse--I
saw in them</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>her laugh at that."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The relations of the deceased are bound
to send two wax tapers every year, for the
use of the Convent; in default of which
the corpse is taken down and thrown
into the charnel house. Were it not
for the number of vacancies occasioned
by the non-payment of this stipend, the
<a id='Page_304'></a>Capuchins would be unable to find
niches for the number of men who must
die every year in so populous a city as
this.</p>

<p class='c005'>Women are dried as well as the men,
but are not exposed. Nobles are shut
up in chests.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am just returned from seeing Prince
Palagonia become a member of this society.
The beginning of his funeral,
although similar to that of every Lord
in this island, struck me as being as preposterous
as his palace.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was carried to the Convent in
a sedan, attended by all his household.
As soon as he entered the Chapel, the
sedan was opened, and two pages supported
him to an armed chair. Here
he was seated in state, dressed in his
richest clothes--his hair full powdered--a
sword by his side--his hat under
<a id='Page_305'></a>his arm. The Nobility of the island
were assembled to meet him. They all
bowed to the corpse, and after a short
pause the ceremony began.</p>

<p class='c005'>The masses were interwoven in an
Oratorio composed for the occasion,
which, notwithstanding only two days
were given to prepare it, did great credit
to the composer; and the performers,
both vocal and instrumental, gave him
every support. The exordium beginning
with "Ecco il Principe preso da
Dio." "Behold the Prince whom
God hath taken," was in the highest
degree pathetic and affecting. The immortal
Handel could not have exceeded
the energy of the musick, and the
corpse of the departed Prince carried
the words with full force to the heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>I regret that I cannot procure this
excellent piece, since, as we are preparing
to sail on our second voyage
<a id='Page_306'></a>to the Archipelago, I was obliged to
come on board the moment the ceremony
was over.</p>

<p class='c005'>But before I leave this place, I will
raise your philanthropy, by mentioning
a charitable institution which is here carried
to a particular height. I mean a
foundation, by which a number of female
children are not only brought up
in morality and religion, and taught
some useful art, that will enable them
to earn their bread; but when they arrive
at a certain age, and are qualified
to undertake the cares of a family, portions
are assigned to those who choose
to marry. When virgins have these
advantages, their Guardians will never
be long in search of unexceptionable
husbands.</p>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Smyrna, May 27th, 1788.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>After an absence of four months,
we returned here on the 24th instant,
and found the Turks in the
highest spirits. The Emperor has declared
against them: but this was a proceeding
they had been prepared for;
and, far from his arms having as yet
been attended with any decisive success,
he tarnished them in the onset, by beginning
the war in a pusillanimous style,
not at all expected from so powerful an
enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>We had scarce left this country, before
advice was received of a treacherous attempt
<a id='Page_308'></a>to take Belgrade; but the slovenly
manner in which this enterprise was
conducted, gave the Emperor an opportunity
of denying his being privy to it.
It proved unsuccessful; and, as the
Baron De Herbert, the Imperial Minister,
had changed his threats into negociations
for settling a peace between
Turkey and Russia, the Porte, unwilling
to provoke the Emperor to hostilities,
and in hopes that this failure would
discourage him from pursuing his designs
against a people who were so much
better prepared than he expected, very
politically seemed to admit the Internuncio's
excuses for this breach of faith.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seems, that an officer who had
passed through Belgrade, reported at
Vienna, that the fortifications were in
a most ruinous state, and that none of
the cannon were fit for service. On
this fallacious information, orders were
hastily sent to Generals Mitrowski and
<a id='Page_309'></a>Alvinzy, to pass the Save, with a detachment
of troops, who were to be supported
by Generals De Gomingen and
Klebeck, and to make an immediate attempt
on this important fortress; but
the latter Generals not arriving at the
appointed time, and the fortifications
appearing in a very different state from
that in which they had been represented,
Mitrowski and Alvinzy were obliged to
retreat, and to repass the Save.</p>

<p class='c005'>Notwithstanding the Internuncio's disavowal
of the Emperor's knowledge of
this attempt, accounts were soon received,
that Generals Mitrowski and De
Gomingen were ordered to Vienna, to
answer for their failure; and, on the
8th of February, Baron De Herbert delivered
a formal declaration of war.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the journey to Cherson, the unremitting
armaments which immediately
followed, and, to crown the whole, the
<a id='Page_310'></a>treacherous attempt upon Belgrade, the
Imperial Manifesto, to the surprise of
every body, begins in the following
manner.--</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"All Europe have been witness</div>
      <div class='line'>to the good faith with which the</div>
      <div class='line'>Court of his Imperial Majesty has,</div>
      <div class='line'>for many years, cultivated peace with</div>
      <div class='line'>the Ottoman Empire; the sincere dispositions</div>
      <div class='line'>it has manifested, on every</div>
      <div class='line'>occasion, to preserve their good neighbourhood;</div>
      <div class='line'>its disinterested and indefatigable</div>
      <div class='line'>endeavours to avoid any</div>
      <div class='line'>interruption of their mutual harmony,</div>
      <div class='line'>and its readiness to lend every office of</div>
      <div class='line'>mediation, to prevent any rupture between</div>
      <div class='line'>the Porte and the neighbouring</div>
      <div class='line'>Courts.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>These pacific intentions, &amp;c. &amp;c."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Notwithstanding the serious events
which this declaration must produce, it
was impossible for the Porte to refrain
from laughing at the bare-faced manner
<a id='Page_311'></a>in which the Emperor attempted to impose
on the understandings of the rest
of the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>The declaration of war was read to the
Imperial troops in Croatia on the 9th
of February, and the same day Dresnick
was attacked by them. The garrison
consisted of only seventy men;
but this little corps made a most gallant
defence, and, small as their numbers
were, they obliged the enemy to set fire
to the place before they could compel
them to surrender.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same moment a second detachment
made an attempt on Sturlich,
another inconsiderable post. The Turkish
Commandant reserved his fire till
the Austrians were near enough for
every shot to take place, he then
gave them a volley, which destroyed a
considerable number of the enemy. The
place, however, was afterwards taken;
<a id='Page_312'></a>and, it is said, that in revenge for the
loss the Imperialists had sustained, they
put all the prisoners to the sword. I
cannot believe this report, notwithstanding
the following account published by
authority.</p>

      <div class='line'>on the detachment, as to kill fifty</div>
      <div class='line'>men, which so enraged the Imperialists,</div>
      <div class='line'>that they put the whole Turkish garrison</div>
      <div class='line'>to death."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I do not think this account at all extenuates
the severity, which it admits to
have been exercised; for I never knew
that it was the custom to accompany a
flag of truce by an armed force; neither
<a id='Page_313'></a>was it very military in the German
Officer to advance with his whole detachment,
even had he imagined the
place was going to surrender, before he
sent a party to receive the post from the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Imperial army now took post
with their left flank on the river Korana,
near Dresnick, and their right towards
the mountains of Plessivicza, so as to
have the road to Bihacz open before
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the mean while, a considerable corps
under Colonel Kesnowick passed the
Unna, and attacked Turkish Dubitza,
but were repulsed with a heavy loss.
The Austrians themselves acknowledge
to have had 431 men killed and wounded.</p>

<p class='c005'>This <i>coup-de-main</i> having failed, Prince
Charles Lichtenstein was sent to commence
<a id='Page_314'></a>a regular siege. He took the
command of the army early in March,
and on the 25th of April, a practicable
breach being made, the Imperialists advanced
to the assault. They met a very
unexpected reception, being themselves
most furiously charged by the Turks,
which threw them into such confusion
and dismay, that they were soon repulsed,
and the garrison sallying out,
without giving them time to form, drove
them headlong through their own
trenches, burnt their works, and obliged
Prince Lichtenstein to cross the Unna
that very night, and secure himself on
the opposite heights.</p>

<p class='c005'>A besieged garrison routing a besieging
army in so complete a style, is such
an extraordinary circumstance, that I
was anxious to hear what turn the Imperialists
would give it. Their account
is so curious a one, that I shall subjoin
it for you.</p>
<p class='c004'><a id='Page_315'></a>Vienna, May 3d, 1788.</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"An attempt was made by the Austrians</div>
      <div class='line'>on the 25th April to storm</div>
      <div class='line'>Dubitza, but they were repulsed as</div>
      <div class='line'>they were entering the breach they</div>
      <div class='line'>had made. In return, the Turks,</div>
      <div class='line'>having received a reinforcement, which</div>
      <div class='line'>augmented the garrison to the number</div>
      <div class='line'>of twelve thousand men, sallied out,</div>
      <div class='line'>and attacked the Austrians in their</div>
      <div class='line'>trenches. A general action then</div>
      <div class='line'>commenced, which lasted three hours,</div>
      <div class='line'>and though the Austrians were victorious,</div>
      <div class='line'>Prince Lichtenstein thought</div>
      <div class='line'>proper, all his works being destroyed,</div>

      <div class='line'>territories from the incursions of</div>
      <div class='line'>the enemy."</div>

<p class='c005'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. <span class='small'>The day he attempted to storm the garrison.</span></p>

</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_316'></a>Thus we see, that <i>though the Austrians
were victorious</i>, their works were destroyed,
the siege was raised, and their
army obliged to retreat--to pass a river
in the night--and to intrench themselves
on the opposite heights, to defend
the country of the conquerors, from the
incursions of the vanquished. An odd
kind of victory this.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a subsequent account the Austrians
mention Generals Klun and Schlaun
being wounded, the latter mortally;
and they acknowledge to have had five
Lieutenant-Colonels, three Captains, four
Lieutenants, and 508 rank and file killed
and wounded, besides horses. Some
few privates they say were missing, and
two field pieces, which were advanced
to the attack, were taken by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>These are the latest accounts from the
banks of the Unna.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_317'></a>I shall now proceed eastward, and you
have only to follow me in this direction
along the frontiers, to have a
full view of the Imperial armies in the
order you will find them on the map.</p>

<p class='c005'>While Prince Lichtenstein was laying
an unsuccessful siege to Dubitza, which
ended in a complete overthrow; in consequence
of which we have left him on
the Austrian side of the Unna, threatened
in his new intrenchments, the Grand
Imperial Army advanced opposite to Sabacz,
on the banks of the Save, about
two days march west of Belgrade, where
they remained till the Emperor arrived,
in order that his taking the field might
be marked by a successful enterprise.
But, even according to the Vienna account,
Sabacz contained but 17 pieces of
cannon, and the garrison amounted to
only 800 men.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_318'></a>It should seem, however, as if the
Austrian Generals, in compliment to
their Sovereign, wished to conceal the
weakness of the object of their enterprise
by the pomp of the attack. A regular
siege was commenced, trenches were
opened, and the batteries being completed
by the 23d of April, began a heavy
cannonade, which soon overpowered the
fire of the Turks. Nevertheless they
kept possession of a few rotten walls,
which served by way of outwork, till
a column, composed of the riflemen of
the regiment of Peterwaradin, of the
free corps of Servia, and the regiment
Esterhazy, advanced to storm them. On
this attack the Turks retreated into the
interior part of their works, and finding
it in vain, in such a place, to contend
any longer against the grand army of
the Emperor, and a numerous train of
artillery, they surrendered their post.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_319'></a>The Emperor gave the Turks great
credit for their defence, and much to
his honour, treated the prisoners with
attention, sending their wives and children
to their own country.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the few hours the Austrian
fire was kept up, their batteries were
well served, and the troops ordered to
the assault, advanced with great spirit.
In short, this enterprise would have
done honor to the Emperor's arms, had
it been worth the time, labour, and expence
he bestowed to achieve it.</p>

<p class='c005'>His people boast, that among the
trophies are twenty pair of colours, but
they do not inform us how the number
of standards came to be near three
times that of the cannon, or why eight
hundred men should have forty colours.
And the Turks say, that till the Grand
Vizir can find him better employment,
they have no objection to his Imperial
<a id='Page_320'></a>Majesty taking every village on the
Save on the same terms he paid for
Sabacz.</p>

<p class='c005'>The number of men the Austrians lost
is not exactly known; the accounts
from Vienna only mention that Prince
Poniatowski, and the Baron de Refroy,
a General of Artillery, are among the
wounded.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was supposed that as soon as the
Emperor took the command of his
Grand Army, that he would have besieged
Belgrade, but by the latest accounts
he was very quiet in the neighbourhood
of Semlin.</p>

<p class='c005'>The troops employed on the banks
of the Danube, between Belgrade and
Orsowa, under Generals Wartensleben
and Papilla, have had several rencounters
with the Turks, with various success;
but the only event of any consequence,
<a id='Page_321'></a>in this part of the seat of war, was an
attempt upon Semendria, in which the
Imperialists were repulsed with considerable
loss.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Fabricius, who commands
the Austrians in Transylvania, has done
nothing decisive, and several of his
posts have been carried off by the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Prince De Saxe Cobourg, a General
I much admire, entered Moldavia
early in March, with the most eastern
of the Emperor's armies. This province
is governed by a Greek Prince, who is
appointed by the Porte, but who wishing
to give himself up to the Germans, sent
them a scheme to get possession of his
person, which was executed with such
secrecy, that in the night a detachment
of the enemy carried him off from the
middle of his capital.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_322'></a>It should seem as if the Austrians
thought the possession of his person of
the greatest consequence, since the moment
they got him, they fled with the
utmost precipitation, without attempting
to destroy the magazines, or to do any
other damage.</p>

<p class='c005'>It does not, however, appear that the
defection of this Chief was of any great
detriment to the Turkish cause, since
the Austrian General only passed through
the north-west corner of the province,
directing his march by Suczawa and
Siret, towards Choczim, the most northern
fortress in the possession of the
Turks, and their chief frontier towards
Poland, distant from Constantinople about
five hundred miles.</p>

<p class='c005'>The grand exertions of the Russians
are against Oczakow. The Captain Bashaw
sailed for the relief of that fortress
on the 20th of May, but it is
<a id='Page_323'></a>feared that the enemy are already in
possession of both sides of the Liman,
by which means their ships, covered by
the batteries on shore, may prevent the
Turkish fleet from being of any use to
the garrison.</p>

<p class='c005'>The rendezvous of the Ottoman army
was first at Adrianople, about 120 miles
from the capital, and afterwards at Sophia,
near two hundred miles farther
on the road to Belgrade. As fast as
the troops were assembled, large detachments
were sent to all the garrisons
on the frontiers, and there are now
80,000 men still left at Sophia; with
these, and some other corps, the Grand
Vizir will march against the Emperor;
and should his Imperial Majesty choose
to enter the Ottoman territories, or attempt
to besiege Belgrade, a decisive
battle must ensue.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_324'></a>It will be some weeks before you hear
from me again from this port, since
I shall set out to-morrow on a tour to
Macedonia; and before I return, I propose
visiting Lesbos, Tenedos, Lemnos,
and several other of the Greek islands.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>LETTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Smyrna, October 20th, 1788.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>In my last letter, we left the Austrian
General, Prince of Saxe Cobourg,
directing his march towards Choczim.
He sat down before that fortress about
the middle of March, and immediately
began to invest it; but the moment the
Turks were informed that the enemy
had entered Moldavia, they detached a
corps of 40,000 men, to drive them out
of the province.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the approach of these troops, the
Prince of Saxe Cobourg was obliged to
raise the siege; and, on the 16th and
<a id='Page_326'></a>17th of May, he crossed the Dniester, and
retired, with his whole army, out of the
Turkish territories: but, being afterwards
reinforced by a large corps of Russians,
he again, on the 2d of July, advanced
towards Choczim, and, by the 23d, the
greatest part of the town was reduced
to ashes. The Turks, however, continued
to defend themselves with great
valour, till the end of September,
when they were obliged to surrender
their post. The garrison, consisting of
about 3,000 men, marched out with the
honours of war.</p>

<p class='c005'>The grand army of the Russians,
under Prince Potemkin; and the fleet
under the Prince of Nassau, are laying
close siege to Oczakow. I have already
mentioned the Captain Bashaw's
departure for the protection of this
fortress. The Russian fleet met him at
the northern part of the Black Sea; but,
finding the Turkish force much greater
<a id='Page_327'></a>than they expected, they retreated without
giving battle.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Captain Bashaw immediately
threw out the signal for a general chace;
but, owing to the superior sailing of the
Russian fleet, only four of his line of
battle ships got within gunshot of the
enemy, and even these could keep up
with them but a very short time.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Russians made the best of their
way towards Kimbourn; and the Captain
Bashaw, the moment this partial
action was over, executed two of his
Captains for not having made those
exertions he expected, and sailed in pursuit
of the enemy, with these delinquents
hanging at his yard-arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Turkish ships appear to me just
what we conceive of the Spanish Armada;
and we have seen how difficult it is for
such a fleet to act to advantage against
<a id='Page_328'></a>an evading enemy, who, though much
inferior in numbers, is considerably farther
advanced in nautical skill, and in
the science of artillery.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Russians, with the utmost diligence,
secured themselves within the
Liman, covered by the guns of Kimbourn
and the opposite batteries. The
Captain Bashaw, finding their position
too strong to admit of a direct attack,
embarked his troops in his gun-boats and
small-craft, in hopes that, by a <i>coup de
main</i>, he should possess himself of the
enemy's batteries, and open a passage for
his ships; but in this attempt he was
unsuccessful; and several of his boats,
getting aground, were burnt by the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have not heard that he has since
been able to throw any succours into
Oczakow; but the garrison, which is
numerous and well supplied, defend
<a id='Page_329'></a>themselves with great resolution; and, in
a grand attack which Prince Potemkin
made on the out-works, he was repulsed
with very considerable loss.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Russian fleet, though it co-operates
with the army, may be said to be itself
blocked up by the Captain Bashaw; and,
as there is every reason to suppose that
the garrison of Oczakow will be able to
sustain itself till the severe weather sets
in (which, in that climate, surpasses what
people in England can conceive), Prince
Potemkin will be obliged either to keep
the field during the whole winter, to
the extreme distress, and probable mortality
of his army, or to risk the destruction
of his fleet, which will be frozen
up, and exposed to the attacks of the
Oczakowians.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following is the Imperial account
of the <i>coup de main</i> attempted by the
Captain Bashaw:</p>
<p class='c004'><a id='Page_330'></a>"Vienna, July 9th.</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The Captain Bashaw, being at anchor</div>
      <div class='line'>with his fleet near Oczakow, sent</div>
      <div class='line'>all his light vessels, gun-boats, and</div>
      <div class='line'>small craft, to the number of fifty-seven</div>
      <div class='line'>sail, to attack the Russian vessels,</div>
      <div class='line'>consisting of twenty-seven sail of the</div>
      <div class='line'>same sort and size. The Prince of</div>
      <div class='line'>Nassau placed his force in a position</div>
      <div class='line'>that prevented an attack in line, and</div>
      <div class='line'>exerted himself in such a manner, as</div>
      <div class='line'>not only to repulse the Turks, but to</div>
      <div class='line'>gain a victory over them. Two of</div>
      <div class='line'>their vessels were blown up, one sunk,</div>
      <div class='line'>and the rest were thrown into confusion,</div>
      <div class='line'>and driven back, with great</div>
      <div class='line'>loss, <i>till they got under the protection of</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>the Turkish ships of the line</i><a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. <span class='small'>This sentence is printed in <i>Italics</i>, to mark,
that, though published by the Confederate and Ally
of the Empress of Russia, it contradicts the account
given in the Petersburgh Gazette, in which the
small craft were magnified into ships of the line.</span></p>

</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_331'></a>The accounts from the east of the
Crimea are, that the Tartars and Russians
have had frequent actions, but
with no very decisive success on either
side.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us now leave the Moscovites, and
turn to the Imperialists on the western
side of the theatre of war.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon after the defeat of Prince Lichtenstein
by the garrison of Dubitza, the
Turks crossed the Unna, in pursuit of
him, and, for some time, pressed him in
his intrenchments; but, the moment the
news of his disaster reached the Emperor,
four squadrons of dragoons, and
seven battalions of infantry, were ordered
to his assistance.</p>

<p class='c005'>To lead these troops, and to reanimate
his army, the Emperor called forth the
great Laudohn--a gallant veteran, to
whom every Soldier must look up with
<a id='Page_332'></a>veneration and respect. He was now in
an advanced age, and had retired from
the field of arms, to end his days under
the shade of his laurels. The Genius of
Austria seemed to call upon him for
relief. Roused by her cries, and by the
voice of the Emperor and the People,
the veteran hero regained the powers of
youth, and armed once more to lead the
Imperial banners to victory.</p>

<p class='c005'>When so great a character appears
upon the stage, we can scarcely refrain
from wishing him success, whatever may
be the merits of his cause. An ambitious
tyrant may plunge his nation into
an unjust war, and his people may be
prejudiced enough to support him in it;
but the Soldier is neither accountable for
the crimes of the one, nor for the follies
of the other. His duty as a loyal subject,
and his virtue as a patriotic citizen,
oblige him to exert himself to the utmost,
whenever his services are called upon;
<a id='Page_333'></a>and, without entering into the politics by
which his country is actuated, he feels
himself engaged to promote, to the full
extent of his power, the success of her
arms, in whatever wars she is unhappily
embarked.--Such a character is Marshal
Laudohn: but of his Court I by no
means entertain such favorable sentiments.</p>

<p class='c005'>As an Englishman, policy obliges me
to wish success to the Turks; for I have
already proved to you, that our lucrative
trade to the Levant can never be carried
on so much to our advantage as whilst
Turkey remains in the hands of its present
possessors; and, as a Philanthrope,
I feel the utmost detestation of the ambitious
combination entered into by the
Emperor and the Empress, to extirpate
the Turks, merely because Nature has
been bountiful to their soil, and because
their country promised an easy
conquest.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_334'></a>These Powers could scarcely imagine
that Europe would look on with indifference;
but they trusted that they
had a sufficient party to prevent any
open declaration in favor of the injured
Turks. These expectations, however,
the disturbances in Brabant, and the total
suspension of the power of France, must
have frustrated. Blush, then, O Prussia!
if you neglect this favorable opportunity
of shewing your justice and magnanimity.--But,
still more feelingly shall I
say, blush, O England! if you do not, at
least, insist on an honourable peace for
the Turks. Let every thing the Imperial
Courts may take from them, be restored;
but, above all things, prevent the Russians
obtaining any solid establishment on the
Black Sea, or infringing the Grand
Signior's right to prevent ships of force,
or warlike stores, passing the Bosphorus
and Dardanelles. Let the Porte, at least,
sit down on the same conditions she
was forced to accept by the Treaty of
<a id='Page_335'></a>Cainardgie--a treaty which created her
present distress--a treaty which we ourselves,
in an hour of mistaken policy,
compelled her to submit to, and which
now, that we know our true interests, we
are bound to redress.</p>

<p class='c005'>What has become of that spirit of
virtue and generosity, which, not fifty
years ago, led us to enter into an expensive
war, in favor of Maria Theresa,
merely because she was then an unfortunate
Princess, oppressed by an ambitious
neighbour, whose usurpations,
like those of Russia, threatened in time
to affect ourselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is, no doubt, a considerable abatement
of the honest joy an Englishman
feels in contemplating this act of magnanimity
in his ancestors, to find, that
ingratitude has been the only return
which has been made to us. In cherishing
Austria and Russia, we may really be
said to have nurtured the viper in our
<a id='Page_336'></a>bosom, which, in the moment of our
distress, attempted a mortal wound, by
forming the <i>Armed Neutrality</i>, or, in
plain language, a <i>combination to supply
our enemies with implements for our
destruction.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>If justice to the Turks, whom we have
reduced to so critical a situation; if a
sense of our national dignity; if our
dearest interest, and commercial concerns,
will not induce us to speak boldly
in a moment like this, self-preservation,
at least, should affect us. Let us recollect,
that Russia is an evil-disposed,
aspiring child; that we now have it in
our power to curb her proud spirit; but
that, if we neglect this opportunity, and
allow her to increase in pride and in
strength, in a few years, perhaps, she
may trample on our breast.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Pax queritur in Bello</i> is a favorite
motto, but <i>Wars guarded against in peace</i>,
<a id='Page_337'></a>is, in my opinion, a much better one;
and this is the motto England ought to
choose. There is nothing, in the present
state of Europe, that Great Britain can in
justice require, but what she must immediately
gain. Let her, then, dictate terms
to Russia, and check her ambitious views.
If she refuses to submit, let threats and
preparations to enforce them, be added;
and shew me the Power who, at this
moment, will dare to oppose the serious
threats of England? Vengeance would
soon overwhelm her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The adverse views of France respecting
the Turks, have become every day more
notorious<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>. Monsieur <i>Le Roy</i>, a naval
Engineer, who was employed in the
Arsenal at Constantinople, has been recalled,
and was lately here on his return
to France. So far, indeed, have that
nation carried their unfriendly measures,
that even two French Officers of Artillery,
and a few Gunners, who were in
the service of the Porte at Oczakow,
have been withdrawn by the Ambassador.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. <span class='small'>The intrigues of the French Court have been
frustrated by the Revolution in their own
country.</span></p>

</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_338'></a>I think I have said enough to convince
you, that, both through interest and
through principle, I sincerely hope that
the oppressive views of the two Imperial
Courts may be frustrated; and yet there
is something so fascinating in the appearance
of a Hero, that, I confess to you,
when the accounts of his success arrived,
I did not feel sorry that the walls of
Dubitza had not been able to tarnish the
laurels of old Laudohn.</p>

<p class='c005'>This gallant veteran superseded Prince
Lichtenstein, and took the command of
the army in Croatia, in the month of
August. He immediately advanced to
<a id='Page_339'></a>Dubitza, which he took on the 26th of
the same month: but he had neither to
contend with the garrison that repulsed
Colonel Kesnowick, nor with the army
that defeated Prince Lichtenstein; for
the Grand Vizier, having resolved to invade
Hungary, and to carry the war into
the enemy's country, had drawn together
all the troops he could collect, in order
pass the Danube in as great force as
possible; and, not thinking that the
Austrians would so soon return to a place
which had already, in this campaign,
twice proved fatal to their arms, he reduced
the garrison of Dubitza to so small
a number, that, according to the Imperial
account, at the time it surrendered, it did
not amount to 400 men.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whether it was, that the Emperor did
not find himself sufficiently provided to
carry the war with vigour into the
Turkish territories, or that the sickness
which prevailed among his troops
<a id='Page_340'></a>frustrated his intended operations, I cannot
pretend to say; but, to the surprise of
every body, the grand Imperial army,
commanded by the Sovereign in person,
remained inactive in the neighbourhood
of Semlin, the whole of the months of
May, June and July, and a considerable
part of August; during the greater part
of which time, the Grand Vizir was
not within an hundred miles of the
frontiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>This Chief was extraordinarily late in
taking the held. It was not till the end
of July, that he pitched his camp at
Nissa; but from this place, he pursued
with vigour his grand object, to carry
the war into the enemy's country.</p>

<p class='c005'>For this purpose, he turned out of the
direct road to Belgrade, opposite to
which, in the vicinity of Semlin, the Imperialists
were encamped, and, directing
his march immediately towards Hungary,
<a id='Page_341'></a>crossed the Danube, and, with his whole
force, invaded that kingdom.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Austrian General, Wartensleben,
who had been ordered to watch the
motions of the enemy about Orsowa,
occupied a strong post in the vicinity of
Meadia, from which an advanced corps
of the Grand Vizir's army, drove him on
the 28th of August.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to the Turkish plan I saw
of this action, the defile lies between two
high mountains; and in the bottom, a
little within the pass, lies the town. The
Austrians were encamped on the hill
on the right, which was looked upon as
unassailable on the side towards the
Turks. But these enthusiastic people
stormed these stupendous heights with
the most romantic bravery, and carried
them, sword in hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not valour only, which distinguished
the Turks on this occasion; for
<a id='Page_342'></a>the Seraskier who commanded, sent a
considerable detachment previous to the
attack, to make a circuit, and get to the
interior side of the hill on the left, that,
if his efforts were crowned with success,
this corps might enable him to reap the
fruit of his labours, by appearing on the
flank of the enemy, and cutting off their
retreat from the town. In this they
completely succeeded. Meadia fell into
their hands; and General Wartensleben
was obliged to retreat towards Slatina,
leaving all his magazines in the hands of
the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as the Emperor was informed
of the invasion of Hungary, he put his
grand army in motion; and, on the 30th
of August, he had reached Caransebes,
within two days march of General Wartensleben's
corps; but the news of this
General's defeat, checked his Majesty's
progress. On the 3d of September,
however, he again resumed his march,
<a id='Page_343'></a>and, advancing towards Slatina, fixed his
camp at Illova.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the mean while, the Seraskier and
his detachment, after securing the magazines,
remained in the neighbourhood of
Meadia some days, waiting the arrival of
the Grand Vizir, who immediately advanced,
to offer battle to the grand Imperial
army, and, on the 10th of September,
encamped in sight of the enemy.
The Emperor, however, declined the attack.
The Grand Vizir, therefore, began
a war of posts, by which, in a few days,
he reduced the enemy to the alternative
of either quitting their position, or of
seeing their retreat cut off, should their
intrenchments be stormed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among other movements, a considerable
corps were ordered, on the 14th, to
turn the right wing of the Austrians.
The Turks made this attack with such
impetuosity, that they completely routed
<a id='Page_344'></a>all this part of the enemy's line, and the
Spahis cut to pieces the whole regiment
of Wurmser Hussars.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Grand Vizir was now enabled to
cannonade the Emperor's camp; and, on
the 21st, having brought all his schemes
to bear, and taken every means to frustrate
the enemy's retreat, should victory crown
the Ottoman arms, he advanced to attack
the grand Imperial army. The Emperor,
however, did not think fit to risk the
event, but broke up his camp, and retreated
with the greatest precipitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Turks had now all the honour
and advantages of a victory, without the
trouble of fighting for one. The Emperor
fled before them; and his rear,
with a great part of his baggage and
artillery, fell a prey to the enemy. Some
thousands of his troops were killed, or
taken, and his whole army thrown into
such confusion, that, in the night, two of
<a id='Page_345'></a>his columns, meeting unexpectedly, fired
on each other.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is said that the Emperor once attempted
to rally his troops, but that, on
this occasion, he himself was very near
being taken prisoner.</p>

<p class='c005'>This glorious success was announced
by the guns of the Seraglio, on the 3d of
October. A general Thanksgiving was
immediately performed, and orders issued
for proclaiming the Grand Signior <i>gazi</i>,
or victorious.</p>

    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Constantinople, Jan. 1st, 1789.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>An unexpected opportunity having
offered to carry us to Constantinople,
we set sail for the Dardanelles on
the 25th Oct. having previously sent to
desire an express might meet us there,
with the Grand Signior's permission to
pass the forts, and go up to his capital.
A favor, which, through the interest of
Sir Robert Ainslie, our Ambassador, the
Porte very readily granted.</p>

<p class='c005'>This permission, however, is a compliment
seldom or ever paid to a man
of war of any nation, except when she
<a id='Page_347'></a>has an Ambassador on board; and it was
the more flattering to us, because L'Iris,
a French frigate, commanded by the
Viscount D'Orleans, which was lying
close to us, applied for it in vain at the
moment we gained it. To add to the
compliment, the Governor of the forts
which command the pass, promised to
salute us.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nothing could be more delightful than
our voyage through these straits. The
country on each side is beautifully picturesque,
and the situation in itself highly
interesting. The Dardanelles, you recollect,
are the ancient Hellespont, and
the spots on which the forts stand, are
famous for the loves of Hero and Leander.
Behind us were the Tomb of
Achilles, the Semois and Scamander, the
celebrated rivers of Troy, and every
point brought an interesting character to
our view.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_348'></a>The day was most heavenly; and
our ship, elegantly painted, and all her
appointments in the highest order, formed
in herself a most beautiful object. Every
sail was set, and the breeze had just
strength enough to enable her to overcome
the force of the current. This
occasional slowness of her motion, added
to the majesty of her appearance, and
one might almost have fancied that she
herself was conscious of the compliments
she was receiving from the mouths of
the cannon of Europe and Asia.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Turks at the Dardanelles always
salute with ball, and the nearer they go
to the vessel, the greater the compliment.
Each fort fired seventeen guns;
their cannon are monstrous, and the
shot flying <i>en ricochet</i> along the smooth
surface of the water across our bows,
from Europe and Asia alternately, and
throwing up the sand on the opposite
shores, while shouts of applause from
<a id='Page_349'></a>the admiring multitude, hailed us on
our returning their salute, crowned this
charming morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was near dusk when we got to
Galipoli, where the straits open into the
sea of Marmora, and on the 15th of
November we arrived here.</p>

<p class='c005'>The approach to Constantinople by
sea is thought superior to that of Naples,
or Messina, and of course the
finest in the world; we missed seeing
it, by entering at night--a loss we hope
to compensate on our departure.</p>

<p class='c005'>Travellers in general express great
disappointment when they get into the
town; and in comparison of European
capitals, the streets are certainly miserable,
and the buildings in general but
paltry; but as they are much superior to
any I have seen in the Turkish dominions,
<a id='Page_350'></a>I confess that they have exceeded my
expectations.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some of the Mosques are tolerable
edifices, however different from our taste
in the ornamental part of architecture.
To these Christians are prohibited access;
but the Turks, like other people, are
not always proof against bribery. I
have been shewn several, and among the
rest, the celebrated one of St. Sophia,
supposed to have been built by Constantine
the Great. But in which I was
very much disappointed. The dome
only is tolerable. It is supported by two
tier of columns of verde antique. From
this style of architecture, and the value
of the marble, one would expect a rich
and elegant appearance, but the magnificent
effect of the double tier of columns,
is lost by the entablature being
supported by arches, which reduces the
columns to mere piers; and thus, in
<a id='Page_351'></a>comparison of other works of the ancients,
the design becomes poor and inelegant.
The capitals are by no means
chaste, and the architecture throughout
is very indifferently executed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Navy Hospital, though small,
would do credit to any nation; and some
of the Grand Signior's summer palaces,
constructed in the Chinese style, display
an elegant neatness which could not
be surpassed, even by that ingenious people.
But the Seraglio, as far as I was
admitted, has nothing to boast of. I
have been through most parts of the
first court on the inside, which contain
the Mint, and some other public offices,
and have once or twice been just within
the gate of the Seraglio gardens; but to
the inner court no common bribe will
gain a Christian admittance, except when
an Ambassador has an audience of the
Sultan, and this happens but once
during his residence; for Foreign Ministers
<a id='Page_352'></a>transact no business with the
Grand Signior in person, and never visit
him but on their arrival, to deliver their
credentials.</p>

<p class='c005'>We are lucky enough to be here at
such a moment, for the new Venetian
Ambassador is to have his audience of
introduction in a few days, and has
promised to take me in his suite. On
this occasion, I shall have the honor
of dining with the Reis Effendi, and
the other Grand Officers of State, in the
interior part of the Seraglio.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have already seen the Grand Signior
several times, for he goes publicly to
Mosque every Friday; and I attended
the Prussian Envoy when he had his
audience of the Caimacan, or acting
Grand Vizir, from whom I had the honor
of receiving a muslin handkerchief.
It is not very fine, being only intended
as a mark of amity, for the Turks
<a id='Page_353'></a>strictly adhere to the Oriental custom of
giving presents, and their government
seems to retain much of its primitive
institution. Civil and religious law, as
in the days of the Patriarchs, form but
one code. The Coran is the book, and
the Mufti the head of both. Like the
practice of earlier ages, also, he who
rules the state in time of peace, leads
her armies in time of war. Thus the
Grand Vizir is at once Prime Minister,
as well as Captain-General, and Commander
in Chief of the forces. The
police of the town resembles the discipline
of a camp; the people retire at
dusk, patroles are established, and in
case of fire, or any other alarm, the
Grand Signior himself, and all the Great
Officers are immediately abroad. Were
the Sovereign to neglect appearing on
occasions of this kind, it would be
thought as great a reflection on him, as
if, as a General, he remained in his tent
when his camp was attacked.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_354'></a>Immense as the Ottoman Empire is,
the whole number of those troops that,
from being constantly embodied, can be
called regulars, amount to but about
twenty-six thousand foot, and a few
thousand horse. Among the former are
a corps of Gardeners, (Bostangi) and
another of Porters (Capigi) and these
are part of the Sultan's body guards.
The head gardener (Bostangi Bashaw) is,
by virtue of his employment, Governor
of all the forts on the Bosphorus, commonly
called the Canal of the Black Sea,
and the first of the Black Eunuchs, is
also by his Office, Governor and Commander
in Chief of the Seraglio, or
Grand Palace and Citadel of Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c005'>The canal, including its windings, is
about twenty miles in length, and in
most parts not more than a mile wide,
which defends the capital against an attack
by shipping from the Black Sea,
<a id='Page_355'></a>whilst the Dardanelles, although an hundred
miles distant, protect it against men
of war from the Mediterranean. The
last of these straits, at the points on
which the old castles stand, are only
about 1300 yards wide; and although
they expand immediately, yet for the
course of forty miles a ship can seldom
be out of gunshot from one or other
side.</p>

<p class='c005'>A strong north wind blows all summer,
which renders it impossible for vessels to
force their way up at that season, and
the current at all times sets so strong,
that even with a fair wind, they must
be exposed for several hours to a very
hot fire. The castles are close to the
water's edge; they have each two tier
of guns, many of the lower carry balls
of eighteen inches diameter, and when
an enemy is in force in the Mediterranean,
the whole extent of the Dardanelles
is lined with batteries.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_356'></a>The town properly called Constantinople,
is a kind of Peninsula, in the
form of a triangle, one side of which
is washed by the sea of Marmora, at the
north end of which it stands; the second
by the harbour, on which the canal
opens; this side fronts the north, and,
except the Seraglio, which forms the
east salient angle, is entirely open. There
is nothing towards the sea of Marmora,
except a dead wall, the Turks trusting
to the defences I have already mentioned,
against an attack by sea. Neither do
they seem more apprehensive on the
third, or land side, for the ancient triple
wall, which, by running across from the
bottom of the harbour to the sea of Marmora,
cuts the town from the country,
is falling to decay. I found it to be near
five miles in length, and the only part
of it kept in repair, is the Castle of the
Seven Towers, now converted into a
state prison. English artillery would lay
<a id='Page_357'></a>both it and the Seraglio in ashes in half
an hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>Besides the triangle I have just described,
the populous towns of Pera,
Galata, and Tophana, which run into
each other on the opposite side of the
harbour, are also included in what is
commonly called Constantinople. Galata
contains the dockyard and naval arsenal;
Tophana the ordnance and foundry,
and Pera is the residence of the Foreign
Ministers. No part of these three
towns have even a mud wall to defend
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Janizaries form the chief part of
the standing army. They are still highly
respected both by the court and the people,
but have lost so much of their former
consequence, that at the commencement
of the present war, the Grand
Vizir broke a whole chamber, or regiment
<a id='Page_358'></a>of them, for showing a spirit of
discontent. A severity, which though
just, none of his predecessors, nor even
the Sultans themselves dared ever attempt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Abdoul Hamet, the Grand Signior,
is upwards of sixty years old; but he
possesses an engaging, benevolent countenance;
and I like him the more from
his attention to his wives; for although
he may have as many of the most beautiful
women as he pleases, yet he has
attached himself to one. His happy
favorite is now pregnant for the fourth
time, and such is the attention paid her,
that the vessels in the harbour are obliged
to suspend the regular method of carrying
on duty, and are not permitted to
fire a musket, nor to strike the bell, nor
even to give the word of command in
a loud voice. By which you will perceive,
that the invisible chains of the
fair are as powerful in Turkey as in our
<a id='Page_359'></a>blessed island; and that the rude Turk,
and the generous Englishman, though
different in manners, are alike sensible
of the respect due to gentleness and
beauty.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>TO CAPTAIN SMITH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c010'><span class='small'>Constantinople, Jan. 24th, 1789.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c014'>The Porte having given a decisive
answer, relative to the frigates
which were brought to Constantinople
to be sold, we shall sail for Gibraltar
immediately. We have been detained
here much longer than we expected, but
the hospitality and munificence of Sir
Robert Ainslie, have amply compensated
this delay; and it is with the greatest
regret, that I see myself on the eve of
leaving his society, and of quitting a
place where the hearts of every one seem
to wish to detain us.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_361'></a>Nothing could exceed the animation
of the Turks at the moment of our arrival
at this capital. The King of Sweden
had relieved the Porte from a great part
of the force of the Russians, and the
accounts of the glorious victories of Meadia
and Caransebes, obtained over the
Emperor, were confirmed and increased
by the hundreds of prisoners who were
daily brought in.</p>

<p class='c005'>So complete a panic pervaded the
Imperial troops, that on an alarm of the
enemy's approach, the heavy baggage,
which had been sent on towards Temeswar,
was immediately abandoned, and
a great part of it pillaged, and carried off
by a corps of Partisans.</p>

<p class='c005'>But at this moment, when victory,
with extended wings, was following the
Ottoman arms, and when each day
brought them fresh advantages, the Grand
Vizir suddenly halted, and then turned
<a id='Page_362'></a>to the left. It was still hoped, however,
that his operations would continue offensive;
but probably reflecting on the danger
of not finding subsistance for so immense
an army, during the approaching winter,
should he pursue the Emperor into the
heart of his country, and that the Imperial
armies from Transylvania and
Moldavia might come down and cut
him off from the Danube, he had determined
not to lose sight of the banks
of that river; and that, instead of pursuing
the Emperor at random, wherever
he chose to lead him, he had resolved
to secure the conquests he had made,
which would enable him to winter with
safety in the enemy's country.</p>

<p class='c005'>This opinion was, for some time,
strengthened by his subsequent movements;
he left a strong garrison in Meadia,
and his march was directed through
the Bannat of Temeswar, and pointed
immediately at Semlin, which, had he
<a id='Page_363'></a>taken, would have secured the left flank
of the chain of posts, by which it
was supposed he would have inclosed
the Bannat. All his motions most
strongly indicated an attempt upon that
fortress, and, as there was no doubt of
his succeeding, the inhabitants fled with
all their effects. A corps of 3000 men,
who were encamped under its walls, to
watch the motions of the garrison of
Belgrade, retired on his approach. He
had been unopposed for six weeks, and
his conduct at Illova had given the Emperor
so formidable an impression of his
vigour and abilities, that his Majesty had
gone in person as far as Arad, to put that
place in a state of defence.</p>

<p class='c005'>But now that the Grand Vizir was in
sight of Semlin, instead of taking this
town, and afterwards wintering in the
Bannat, or in the district the Imperialists
occupied in the spring, he blasted
the hopes of his friends, by withdrawing
<a id='Page_364'></a>his whole force out of the Austrian territories<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am exceedingly sorry that I am not
sufficiently informed to produce those satisfactory
reasons which so sublime a
genius, and so brave a man, must doubtless
possess for this retrograde motion in
the hour of victory. Neither can I
take upon me to advance, that the success
of Marshal Laudohn formed any part
of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>This great General having taken Dubitza
on the 26th of August, marched
for Novi on the 29th. The Bashaw of
Travenick retarded for some time his
operations against that fortress, but having
too courageously attempted to storm
the Austrian trenches, he was repulsed
with a heavy loss. The Marshal now
pursued the siege with vigour, and on
the 21st of September, a practicable
breach being made, he advanced to the
assault, but was now in his turn repulsed,
and the Vienna Gazette acknowledges,
that on this occasion he lost 284 men.
On the 3d of October he renewed the
attack, and the garrison being by this
time reduced to 600 men, were made
prisoners.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. <span class='small'>For which he was afterwards beheaded; but
as both his resolution and abilities were
unquestionably great, his fate was deservedly
lamented by all intelligent people.</span></p>

</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_365'></a>From Novi Marshal Laudohn advanced
to Gradiska; but the overflowing
of the Save obliged him to suspend his
operations, and to retire into winter
quarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>The campaign is now closed, except
in the environs of Oczakow, where the
Russian fleet being froze in, the army
is obliged to remain for their defence,
<a id='Page_366'></a>notwithstanding that immense numbers
of their men are every day carried off
by the severity of the weather, and
the scarcity and badness of provisions.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the mean while the Captain Bashaw
has brought his fleet here to refit,
and will resume the blockade of the
Russians as soon as the ice breaks. The
success of this Admiral has not been
so great as his force, abilities, and resolution
gave the Porte reason to expect;
but they are satisfied, that by engaging
almost the whole attention of the Russians,
he paved the way for the success of the
Grand Vizir, whose victories have more
than compensated in the eyes of the
Turks, for the disappointment of the
Captain Bashaw.</p>

<p class='c005'>The squadron from the southward have
brought in three Russian Privateers,
and since there is reason to hope that
<a id='Page_367'></a>Oczakow<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> will hold out, this campaign
has, upon the whole, exceeded the most
sanguine expectations of the Turks. I am
astonished that they have made it out so
well, for their army is really little better
than an animated mob under the command
of a popular leader. I have searched
in vain for field-days or reviews, even
among the standing forces. The only
thing like military exercise, that I could
ever discover, was now and then two or
three men firing at a mark, or practising
themselves in throwing the lance on
horseback.</p>

<p class='c005'>At present the grand army is elated
with victory, and formidable by the spirit
infused by success; but as one or two
defeats will destroy that religious confidence
and enthusiastic fury, which, for a<a id='Page_368'></a>
time, supply the want of discipline and
skill, the third campaign, I am afraid,
will shake this very capital, unless England
and Prussia forbid such a catastrophe,
and by resolute measures, confirm
the expectations of the Porte, and of all
those who wish well to the honor and
interest of the Triple Alliance.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. <span class='small'>A magazine having blown up, and made a
practicable breach, the Russians immediately
advanced to the assault, and, after sacrificing
four thousand men, carried the town.</span></p>

</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_369'></a>
  <h2 class='c003'>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>It was the Author's original intention
to publish his work in two volumes,
one of which was to contain the whole
of his first voyage to the Levant, with
his return to Italy, describing all the
places he visited previous to his departure
from Palermo, whence he set
out on his second voyage to Turkey.</p>

<p class='c005'>This voyage would have formed the
second volume, but finding the time
allowed him on leave of absence insufficient
<a id='Page_370'></a>to complete his design, he
has been obliged, for the present, to
withhold the latter part of it; and
therefore, to make the first in some
degree a complete work in itself, he has
curtailed his journal, and added a brief
account of Constantinople, and of the
leading events in the present war between
the Porte and the two Imperial
Courts. Convinced that these would
never be so interesting as at the present
moment, he could not think of
withholding them from the public till
he should have leisure to publish his
second volume. And indeed, even in
the time since his letters on these important
transactions were written, the
scene, as he foresaw, is entirely changed,
and the Russian and Austrian armies
are now advancing towards Constantinople
with such success, that the safety
of that capital seems no longer to depend
upon the Turks, but on those
Powers, without whose countenance, it
<a id='Page_371'></a>is to be supposed, the Porte would never
have engaged against such superior enemies.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Author during his first voyage,
treated but slightly on the manners
and government of the Turks. The
customs of those people being totally
different from any other nation he
had visited, his respect for the public
would not permit him to offer a particular
description on so slight an acquaintance,
especially as he was to
return to Turkey immediately, and
to pass near a twelvemonth in that
country.</p>

<p class='c005'>He therefore desires to have himself
considered as being now on the point
of leaving Palermo, on his return to
the Archipelago; and if the indulgence
of the Public should give him
sufficient encouragement to appear before
them once more, he will endeavour
<a id='Page_372'></a>to gratify their curiosity, by publishing
the second part of his Tour as
soon as his military duty will permit
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the Author has not been so copious
as he might on Italy and Sicily,
it is out of deference to Mr. Moore
and Mr. Brydone, whose elegant works
have been so universally read and admired,
that but little can now be said on
the same subject.</p>

<p class='c005'>The very liberal and distinguished
patronage with which the Author has
been honored, merits his warmest acknowledgment;
and he has only to add,
that it now rests with the public, either
to encourage him to appear before
them again, or by their silence, to command
his.</p>
